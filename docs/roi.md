# ROI Worksheet (Back-of-the-envelope)

Let:

* `H` = hours/week currently spent searching or mis-answering policy questions
* `C` = fully-loaded hourly cost per SME ($/hour)
* `R` = reduction in time due to InstructifyAI (typ. 30–60%)
* `U` = number of SME users

**Monthly savings ≈** `H * C * R * 4 * U`
Example: 2h/week * $80/h * 40% * 4 * 10 users ≈ **$2,560 / month**

Add: avoided escalations, fewer errors, faster onboarding → secondary savings.
