# Project Achievements

## Phase-1 Walking Skeleton
- Delivered docker-compose dev stack covering api, worker, postgres, redis, and minio to mirror target infrastructure.
- Implemented typed configuration via pydantic-settings with environment profile support and Alembic baseline migrations.
- Built ingestion services for local upload and S3-compatible storage with SHA-256 deduplication, document registry models, and /ingest plus /documents APIs.
- Shipped the Universal Chunker with section-aware splitting, table placeholders, and stable ordering backed by PyMuPDF and BeautifulSoup parsers for PDF and HTML sources.
- Enabled derived chunk streaming, idempotent re-parse orchestration, and manifest tracking across workers and storage.
- Integrated the Label Studio-first curation flow with taxonomy versioning, project config generation, webhook metadata patching, and bulk metadata operations.
- Produced an export pipeline with Jinja2 templates, JSONL and CSV outputs, RAG preset, signed URLs, and reproducible manifests.

## Quality, Suggestions, and Governance
- Added rule-based suggestion detectors (severity, step id, ticket id, datetime) with an accept-suggestion workflow that preserves curator control.
- Enforced curation completeness metrics, parse quality gates, and document status transitions to surface needs_review cases.
- Implemented RBAC with viewer and curator roles, JWT authentication, correlation IDs, and audit APIs that cover chunk edits and system actions.
- Established the scorecard CLI, monitoring endpoints, and CI wiring (lint, mypy, pytest, demo run) to keep regressions visible.

## Roadmap-Ready Foundations
- Versioned parser pipeline, enhanced chunker heuristics, and manifest delta tracking support iterative upgrades without breaking contracts.
- Near-duplicate detection, active-learning queues, and dataset snapshot tooling set up the next phase while honoring scope locks.
- Operations hardened through signed URL governance, tenancy controls, observability dashboards, and queue health checks to stay demo-ready.
