Giant leaps in science usually come from a combination of powerful ideas and great tools. Machine learning is no exception. The success of data-driven learning methods is based on the ingenious ideas of thousands of talented researchers over the field\u2019s 60-year history. But their recent popularity is also fueled by the evolution of hardware and software solutions that make them scalable and accessible. The ecosystem of excellent libraries for numeric computing, data analysis, and machine learning built around Python like NumPy and scikit-learn gained wide adoption in research and industry. This has greatly helped propel Python to be the most popular programming language. Massive improvements in computer vision, text, speech, and other tasks brought by the recent ad- vent of deep learning techniques exemplify this theme. Approaches draw on neural network theory of the last four decades that started working remarkably well in combination with GPUs and highly optimized compute routines. Our goal with building PyTorch over the past five years has been to give researchers the most flexible tool for expressing deep learning algorithms while taking care of the underlying engineering com- plexities. We benefited from the excellent Python ecosystem. In turn, we\u2019ve been fortunate to see the community of very talented people build advanced deep learning models across various domains on top of PyTorch. The authors of this book were among them. I\u2019ve known Sebastian within this tight-knit community for a few years now. He has unmatched talent in easily explaining information and making the complex accessible. Sebastian contributed to many widely used machine learning software packages and authored dozens of excellent tutorials on deep learning and data visualization. Mastery of both ideas and tools is also required to apply machine learning in practice. Getting started might feel intimidating, from making sense of theoretical concepts to figuring out which software packages to install.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 4, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

You\u2019re in for a delightful ride from the basics of data-driven techniques to the most novel deep learning architectures. Within every chapter, you will find concrete code examples applying the introduced methods to a practical task. When the first edition came out in 2015, it set a very high bar for the ML and Python book category. But the excellence didn\u2019t stop there. With every edition, Sebastian and the team kept upgrading and refining the material as the deep learning revolution unfolded in new domains. In this new PyTorch edition, you\u2019ll find new chapters on transformer architectures and graph neural networks. These approaches are on the cutting edge of deep learning and have taken the fields of text understanding and molecular structure by storm in the last two years. You will get to practice them using new yet widely popular software packages in the ecosystem like Hugging Face, PyTorch Lightning, and PyTorch Geometric. The excellent balance of theory and practice this book strikes is no surprise given the authors\u2019 com- bination of advanced research expertise and experience in solving problems hands-on. Sebastian Raschka and Vahid Mirjalili draw from their background in deep learning research for computer vision and computational biology. Hayden Liu brings the experience of applying machine learning methods to event prediction, recommendation systems, and other tasks in the industry. All of the authors share a deep passion for education, and it reflects in the approachable way the book goes from simple to advanced. I\u2019m confident that you will find this book invaluable both as a broad overview of the exciting field of machine learning and as a treasure of practical insights. I hope it inspires you to apply machine learning for the greater good in your problem area, whatever it might be.

If you want to become a machine learning practitioner, a better problem solver, or even consider a career in machine learning research, then this book is for you! However, for a novice, the theoretical concepts behind machine learning can be quite overwhelming. Yet, many practical books that have been published in recent years will help you get started in machine learning by implementing pow- erful learning algorithms. Getting exposed to practical code examples and working through example applications of machine learning is a great way to dive into this field. Concrete examples help to illustrate the broader concepts by putting the learned material directly into action. However, remember that with great power comes great responsibility! In addition to offering hands-on experience with machine learning using Python and Python-based machine learning libraries, this book also introduces the mathematical concepts behind machine learning algorithms, which is essential for using machine learning successfully. Thus, this book is different from a purely practical book; it is a book that discusses the necessary details regarding machine learning concepts, offers intuitive yet informative explanations on how machine learning algorithms work, how to use them, and most importantly, how to avoid the most common pitfalls. In this book, we will embark on an exciting journey that covers all the essential topics and concepts to give you a head start in this field. If you find that your thirst for knowledge is not satisfied, this book references many useful resources that you can use to follow up on the essential breakthroughs in this field.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 24, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

If you are a programmer who wants to keep up with the recent trends in technology, this book is definitely for you. Also, if you are a student or considering a career transition, this book will be both your introduction and a comprehensive guide to the world of machine learning. What this book covers Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data, introduces you to the main subareas of ma- chine learning to tackle various problem tasks. In addition, it discusses the essential steps for creating a typical machine learning model building pipeline that will guide us through the following chapters. Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, goes back to the origins of ma- chine learning and introduces binary perceptron classifiers and adaptive linear neurons. This chapter is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals of pattern classification and focuses on the interplay of optimization algorithms and machine learning. Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, describes the essential machine learning algorithms for classification and provides practical examples using one of the most popular and comprehensive open-source machine learning libraries, scikit-learn. Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets \u2013 Data Preprocessing, discusses how to deal with the most common problems in unprocessed datasets, such as missing data. It also discusses several approach- es to identify the most informative features in datasets and teaches you how to prepare variables of different types as proper inputs for machine learning algorithms. Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction, describes the essential techniques to reduce the number of features in a dataset to smaller sets while retaining most of their useful and discrim- inatory information. It discusses the standard approach to dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis and compares it to supervised and nonlinear transformation techniques. Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, discusses the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for estimating the performances of predictive models.

After introducing different linear models, it also talks about polynomial regression and tree-based approaches. Chapter 10, Working with Unlabeled Data \u2013 Clustering Analysis, shifts the focus to a different subarea of machine learning, unsupervised learning. We apply algorithms from three fundamental families of clustering algorithms to find groups of objects that share a certain degree of similarity. Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch, extends the concept of gradient-based optimization, which we first introduced in Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learn- ing Algorithms for Classification, to build powerful, multilayer neural networks based on the popular backpropagation algorithm in Python. Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, builds upon the knowledge from the previous chapter to provide you with a practical guide for training neural networks more efficiently. The focus of this chapter is on PyTorch, an open-source Python library that allows us to utilize mul- tiple cores of modern GPUs and construct deep neural networks from common building blocks via a user-friendly and flexible API. Chapter 13, Going Deeper \u2013 The Mechanics of PyTorch, picks up where the previous chapter left off and introduces more advanced concepts and functionality of PyTorch. PyTorch is an extraordinarily vast and sophisticated library, and this chapter walks you through concepts such as dynamic computation graphs and automatic differentiation. You will also learn how to use PyTorch\u2019s object-oriented API to implement complex neural networks and how PyTorch Lightning helps you with best practices and minimizing boilerplate code. Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, introduces convolutional neu- ral networks (CNNs). A CNN represents a particular type of deep neural network architecture that is particularly well-suited for working with image datasets. Due to their superior performance compared to traditional approaches, CNNs are now widely used in computer vision to achieve state-of-the-art results for various image recognition tasks. Throughout this chapter, you will learn how convolutional layers can be used as powerful feature extractors for image classification. Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks, introduces another popular neural network architecture for deep learning that is especially well suited for working with text and other types of sequential data and time series data. As a warm-up exercise, this chapter introduces recurrent neural networks for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. Then, we will teach recurrent networks to digest information from books in order to generate entirely new text. Chapter 16, Transformers \u2013 Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms, focuses on the latest trends in natural language processing and explains how attention mechanisms help with modeling complex relationships in long sequences. In particular, this chapter describes the influential transformer architecture and state-of-the-art transformer models such as BERT and GPT.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 26, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The chapter starts with a brief introduction to autoencoders, which is a particular type of neural network architecture that can be used for data compression. The chapter then shows you how to combine the decoder part of an autoencoder with a second neural network that can distinguish between real and synthesized images. By letting two neural networks compete with each other in an adversarial training approach, you will implement a generative adversarial network that generates new handwritten digits. Chapter 18, Graph Neural Networks for Capturing Dependencies in Graph Structured Data, goes beyond working with tabular datasets, images, and text. This chapter introduces graph neural networks that operate on graph-structured data, such as social media networks and molecules. After explaining the fundamentals of graph convolutions, this chapter includes a tutorial showing you how to implement predictive models for molecular data. Chapter 19, Reinforcement Learning for Decision Making in Complex Environments, covers a subcategory of machine learning that is commonly used for training robots and other autonomous systems. This chapter starts by introducing the basics of reinforcement learning (RL) to become familiar with the agent/environment interactions, the reward process of RL systems, and the concept of learning from experience. After learning about the main categories of RL, you will implement and train an agent that can navigate in a grid world environment using the Q-learning algorithm. Finally, this chapter intro- duces the deep Q-learning algorithm, which is a variant of Q-learning that uses deep neural networks. To get the most out of this book Ideally, you are already comfortable with programming in Python to follow along with the code ex- amples we provide to both illustrate and apply various algorithms and models. To get the most out of this book, a firm grasp of mathematical notation will be helpful as well. A common laptop or desktop computer should be sufficient for running most of the code in this book, and we provide instructions for your Python environment in the first chapter. Later chapters will introduce additional libraries and installation recommendations when the need arises. A recent graphics processing unit (GPU) can accelerate the code runtimes in the later deep learning chapters. However, a GPU is not required, and we also provide instructions for using free cloud re- sources.

We are living in an age where data comes in abundance; using self-learning algorithms from the field of machine learning, we can turn this data into knowledge. Thanks to the many powerful open-source libraries that have been developed in recent years, there has probably never been a better time to break into the machine learning field and learn how to utilize powerful algorithms to spot patterns in data and make predictions about future events. In this chapter, you will learn about the main concepts and different types of machine learning. Togeth- er with a basic introduction to the relevant terminology, we will lay the groundwork for successfully using machine learning techniques for practical problem solving.

Not only is machine learning becoming increasingly important in computer science research, but it is also playing an ever-greater role in our everyday lives. Thanks to machine learning, we enjoy ro- bust email spam filters, convenient text and voice recognition software, reliable web search engines, recommendations on entertaining movies to watch, mobile check deposits, estimated meal delivery times, and much more. Hopefully, soon, we will add safe and efficient self-driving cars to this list. Also, notable progress has been made in medical applications; for example, researchers demonstrated that deep learning models can detect skin cancer with near-human accuracy (https://www.nature.com/ articles/nature21056). Another milestone was recently achieved by researchers at DeepMind, who used deep learning to predict 3D protein structures, outperforming physics-based approaches by a substantial margin (https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year- old-grand-challenge-in-biology). While accurate 3D protein structure prediction plays an essential role in biological and pharmaceutical research, there have been many other important applications of machine learning in healthcare recently. For instance, researchers designed systems for predicting the oxygen needs of COVID-19 patients up to four days in advance to help hospitals allocate resources for those in need (https://ai.facebook.com/blog/new-ai-research-to-help-predict-covid-19- resource-needs-from-a-series-of-x-rays/). Another important topic of our day and age is climate change, which presents one of the biggest and most critical challenges. Today, many efforts are be- ing directed toward developing intelligent systems to combat it (https://www.forbes.com/sites/ robtoews/2021/06/20/these-are-the-startups-applying-ai-to-tackle-climate-change). One of the many approaches to tackling climate change is the emergent field of precision agriculture. Here, researchers aim to design computer vision-based machine learning systems to optimize resource deployment to minimize the use and waste of fertilizers. The three different types of machine learning In this section, we will take a look at the three types of machine learning: supervised learning, un- supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. We will learn about the fundamental differences between the three different learning types and, using conceptual examples, we will develop an un- derstanding of the practical problem domains where they can be applied:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 31, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Supervised learn- ing is then the process of modeling the relationship between the data inputs and the labels. Thus, we can also think of supervised learning as \u201clabel learning.\u201d Figure 1.2 summarizes a typical supervised learning workflow, where the labeled training data is passed to a machine learning algorithm for fitting a predictive model that can make predictions on new, unlabeled data inputs: Figure 1.2: Supervised learning process", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 32, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

A supervised learning task with discrete class labels, such as in the previous email spam filtering example, is also called a clas- sification task. Another subcategory of supervised learning is regression, where the outcome signal is a continuous value. Classification for predicting class labels Classification is a subcategory of supervised learning where the goal is to predict the categorical class labels of new instances or data points based on past observations. Those class labels are discrete, un- ordered values that can be understood as the group memberships of the data points. The previously mentioned example of email spam detection represents a typical example of a binary classification task, where the machine learning algorithm learns a set of rules to distinguish between two possible classes: spam and non-spam emails. Figure 1.3 illustrates the concept of a binary classification task given 30 training examples; 15 training examples are labeled as class A and 15 training examples are labeled as class B. In this scenario, our dataset is two-dimensional, which means that each example has two values associated with it: x1 and x2. Now, we can use a supervised machine learning algorithm to learn a rule\u2014the decision boundary represented as a dashed line\u2014that can separate those two classes and classify new data into each of those two categories given its x1 and x2 values: Figure 1.3: Classifying a new data point", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 33, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The predictive model learned by a supervised learning algorithm can assign any class label that was presented in the training dataset to a new, unlabeled data point or instance. A typical example of a multiclass classification task is handwritten character recognition. We can collect a training dataset that consists of multiple handwritten examples of each letter in the alphabet. The letters (\u201cA,\u201d \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC,\u201d and so on) will represent the different unordered categories or class labels that we want to predict. Now, if a user provides a new handwritten character via an input device, our predictive model will be able to predict the correct letter in the alphabet with certain accuracy. How- ever, our machine learning system will be unable to correctly recognize any of the digits between 0 and 9, for example, if they were not part of the training dataset. Regression for predicting continuous outcomes We learned in the previous section that the task of classification is to assign categorical, unordered labels to instances. A second type of supervised learning is the prediction of continuous outcomes, which is also called regression analysis. In regression analysis, we are given a number of predictor (explanatory) variables and a continuous response variable (outcome), and we try to find a relationship between those variables that allows us to predict an outcome. Note that in the field of machine learning, the predictor variables are commonly called \u201cfeatures,\u201d and the response variables are usually referred to as \u201ctarget variables.\u201d We will adopt these conventions throughout this book. For example, let\u2019s assume that we are interested in predicting the math SAT scores of students. (The SAT is a standardized test frequently used for college admissions in the United States.) If there is a relationship between the time spent studying for the test and the final scores, we could use it as train- ing data to learn a model that uses the study time to predict the test scores of future students who are planning to take this test. Figure 1.4 illustrates the concept of linear regression. Given a feature variable, x, and a target variable, y, we fit a straight line to this data that minimizes the distance\u2014most commonly the average squared distance\u2014between the data points and the fitted line. Regression toward the mean The term \u201cregression\u201d was devised by Francis Galton in his article Regression towards Mediocrity in Hereditary Stature in 1886. Galton described the biological phenomenon that the variance of height in a population does not increase over time. He observed that the height of parents is not passed on to their children, but instead, their children\u2019s height regresses toward the population mean.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 34, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In reinforcement learning, the goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment. Since the information about the current state of the environment typically also includes a so-called reward signal, we can think of reinforcement learning as a field related to supervised learning. How- ever, in reinforcement learning, this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measured by a reward function. Through its interaction with the environment, an agent can then use reinforcement learning to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning. A popular example of reinforcement learning is a chess program. Here, the agent decides upon a se- ries of moves depending on the state of the board (the environment), and the reward can be defined as win or lose at the end of the game:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 35, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, a general scheme is that the agent in reinforcement learning tries to maximize the reward through a series of interactions with the environment. Each state can be associated with a positive or negative reward, and a reward can be defined as accomplishing an overall goal, such as winning or losing a game of chess. For instance, in chess, the outcome of each move can be thought of as a different state of the environment. To explore the chess example further, let\u2019s think of visiting certain configurations on the chessboard as being associated with states that will more likely lead to winning\u2014for instance, removing an oppo- nent\u2019s chess piece from the board or threatening the queen. Other positions, however, are associated with states that will more likely result in losing the game, such as losing a chess piece to the opponent in the following turn. Now, in the game of chess, the reward (either positive for winning or negative for losing the game) will not be given until the end of the game. In addition, the final reward will also depend on how the opponent plays. For example, the opponent may sacrifice the queen but eventually win the game. In sum, reinforcement learning is concerned with learning to choose a series of actions that maxi- mizes the total reward, which could be earned either immediately after taking an action or via delayed feedback. Discovering hidden structures with unsupervised learning In supervised learning, we know the right answer (the label or target variable) beforehand when we train a model, and in reinforcement learning, we define a measure of reward for particular actions carried out by the agent. In unsupervised learning, however, we are dealing with unlabeled data or data of an unknown structure. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we are able to explore the structure of our data to extract meaningful information without the guidance of a known outcome variable or reward function.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 36, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Each cluster that arises during the analysis defines a group of objects that share a certain degree of similarity but are more dissimilar to objects in other clusters, which is why clustering is also sometimes called unsupervised classification. Clustering is a great technique for structuring information and deriving meaningful relationships from data. For example, it allows marketers to discover customer groups based on their interests, in order to develop distinct marketing programs.

We will use lowercase, bold-face letters to refer to vectors (\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f) and uppercase, bold- face letters to refer to matrices (\ud835\udf32\ud835\udf32\ud835\udf32\ud835\udf32\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f ).

For example, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 (150) refers to the first dimension of flower example 150, the sepal length. Each row in matrix X represents one flower instance and can be written as a four-dimen- sional row vector, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2208\u211d1\u00d74: \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= [\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc653 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc654 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)] And each feature dimension is a 150-dimensional column vector, \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2208\u211d150\u00d71.

A roadmap for building machine learning systems In previous sections, we discussed the basic concepts of machine learning and the three different types of learning. In this section, we will discuss the other important parts of a machine learning system accompanying the learning algorithm.

Raw data rarely comes in the form and shape that is necessary for the optimal performance of a learning algorithm. Thus, the preprocessing of the data is one of the most crucial steps in any machine learning application. If we take the Iris flower dataset from the previous section as an example, we can think of the raw data as a series of flower images from which we want to extract meaningful features. Useful features could be centered around the color of the flowers or the height, length, and width of the flowers. Many machine learning algorithms also require that the selected features are on the same scale for optimal performance, which is often achieved by transforming the features in the range [0, 1] or a standard normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance, as we will see in later chapters. Some of the selected features may be highly correlated and therefore redundant to a certain degree. In those cases, dimensionality reduction techniques are useful for compressing the features onto a lower-dimensional subspace. Reducing the dimensionality of our feature space has the advantage that less storage space is required, and the learning algorithm can run much faster. In certain cases, di- mensionality reduction can also improve the predictive performance of a model if the dataset contains a large number of irrelevant features (or noise); that is, if the dataset has a low signal-to-noise ratio. To determine whether our machine learning algorithm not only performs well on the training dataset but also generalizes well to new data, we also want to randomly divide the dataset into separate train- ing and test datasets. We use the training dataset to train and optimize our machine learning model, while we keep the test dataset until the very end to evaluate the final model. Training and selecting a predictive model As you will see in later chapters, many different machine learning algorithms have been developed to solve different problem tasks. An important point that can be summarized from David Wolpert\u2019s famous No free lunch theorems is that we can\u2019t get learning \u201cfor free\u201d (The Lack of A Priori Distinctions Between Learning Algorithms, D.H. Wolpert, 1996; No free lunch theorems for optimization, D.H. Wolpert and W.G. Macready, 1997). We can relate this concept to the popular saying, I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail (Abraham Maslow, 1966). For example, each classification algorithm has its inherent biases, and no single classification model en- joys superiority if we don\u2019t make any assumptions about the task. In practice, it is therefore essential to compare at least a handful of different learning algorithms in order to train and select the best performing model. But before we can compare different models, we first have to decide upon a metric to measure performance. One commonly used metric is classification accuracy, which is defined as the proportion of correctly classified instances. One legitimate question to ask is this: how do we know which model performs well on the final test dataset and real-world data if we don\u2019t use this test dataset for the model selection, but keep it for the final model evaluation? To address the issue embedded in this question, different techniques summa- rized as \u201ccross-validation\u201d can be used. In cross-validation, we further divide a dataset into training and validation subsets in order to estimate the generalization performance of the model.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 42, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Therefore, we will make frequent use of hyperparameter optimization techniques that help us to fine-tune the performance of our model in later chapters. We can think of those hyperparameters as parameters that are not learned from the data but represent the knobs of a model that we can turn to improve its performance. This will become much clearer in later chapters when we see actual examples. Evaluating models and predicting unseen data instances After we have selected a model that has been fitted on the training dataset, we can use the test dataset to estimate how well it performs on this unseen data to estimate the so-called generalization error. If we are satisfied with its performance, we can now use this model to predict new, future data. It is im- portant to note that the parameters for the previously mentioned procedures, such as feature scaling and dimensionality reduction, are solely obtained from the training dataset, and the same parameters are later reapplied to transform the test dataset, as well as any new data instances\u2014the performance measured on the test data may be overly optimistic otherwise. Using Python for machine learning Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, and thanks to its very active developer and open-source community, a large number of useful libraries for scientific com- puting and machine learning have been developed. Although the performance of interpreted languages, such as Python, for computation-intensive tasks is inferior to lower-level programming languages, extension libraries such as NumPy and SciPy have been developed that build upon lower-layer Fortran and C implementations for fast vectorized oper- ations on multidimensional arrays. For machine learning programming tasks, we will mostly refer to the scikit-learn library, which is currently one of the most popular and accessible open-source machine learning libraries. In the later chapters, when we focus on a subfield of machine learning called deep learning, we will use the latest version of the PyTorch library, which specializes in training so-called deep neural network models very efficiently by utilizing graphics cards. Installing Python and packages from the Python Package Index Python is available for all three major operating systems\u2014Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux\u2014 and the installer, as well as the documentation, can be downloaded from the official Python website: https://www.python.org. The code examples provided in this book have been written for and tested in Python 3.9, and we generally recommend that you use the most recent version of Python 3 that is available. Some of the code may also be compatible with Python 2.7, but as the official support for Python 2.7 ended in 2019, and the majority of open-source libraries have already stopped supporting Python 2.7 (https:// python3statement.org), we strongly advise that you use Python 3.9 or newer.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 43, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Conda is free and licensed under a permissive open-source license. Its goal is to help with the installation and version management of Python pack- ages for data science, math, and engineering across different operating systems. If you want to use conda, it comes in different flavors, namely Anaconda, Miniconda, and Miniforge: \u2022 Anaconda comes with many scientific computing packages pre-installed. The Anaconda in- staller can be downloaded at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/, and an An- aconda quick start guide is available at https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/ getting-started/. \u2022 Miniconda is a leaner alternative to Anaconda (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda. html). Essentially, it is similar to Anaconda but without any packages pre-installed, which many people (including the authors) prefer. \u2022 Miniforge is similar to Miniconda but community-maintained and uses a different package repository (conda-forge) from Miniconda and Anaconda. We found that Miniforge is a great alternative to Miniconda. Download and installation instructions can be found in the GitHub repository at https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge.

For example: pip install SomePackage Packages for scientific computing, data science, and machine learning Throughout the first half of this book, we will mainly use NumPy\u2019s multidimensional arrays to store and manipulate data. Occasionally, we will make use of pandas, which is a library built on top of NumPy that provides additional higher-level data manipulation tools that make working with tabular data even more convenient. To augment your learning experience and visualize quantitative data, which is often extremely useful to make sense of it, we will use the very customizable Matplotlib library. The main machine learning library used in this book is scikit-learn (Chapters 3 to 11).

For instance, do not worry about installing PyTorch at this point. Chapter 12 will provide tips and instructions when you need them. If you encounter errors even though your code matches the code in the chapter exactly, we recom- mend you first check the version numbers of the underlying packages before spending more time on debugging or reaching out to the publisher or authors. Sometimes, newer versions of libraries introduce backward-incompatible changes that could explain these errors. If you do not want to change the package version in your main Python installation, we recommend using a virtual environment for installing the packages used in this book. If you use Python without the conda manager, you can use the venv library to create a new virtual environment. For example, you can create and activate the virtual environment via the following two commands: python3 -m venv /Users/sebastian/Desktop/pyml-book source /Users/sebastian/Desktop/pyml-book/bin/activate Note that you need to activate the virtual environment every time you open a new terminal or Power- Shell. You can find more information about venv at https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html. If you are using Anaconda with the conda package manager, you can create and activate a virtual environment as follows: conda create -n pyml python=3.9 conda activate pyml Summary In this chapter, we explored machine learning at a very high level and familiarized ourselves with the big picture and major concepts that we are going to explore in the following chapters in more detail. We learned that supervised learning is composed of two important subfields: classification and regression. While classification models allow us to categorize objects into known classes, we can use regression analysis to predict the continuous outcomes of target variables. Unsupervised learning not only offers useful techniques for discovering structures in unlabeled data, but it can also be useful for data compression in feature preprocessing steps. We briefly went over the typical roadmap for applying machine learning to problem tasks, which we will use as a foundation for deeper discussions and hands-on examples in the following chapters. Finally, we set up our Python environment and installed and updated the required packages to get ready to see machine learning in action. Later in this book, in addition to machine learning itself, we will introduce different techniques to preprocess a dataset, which will help you to get the best performance out of different machine learning algorithms.

Trying to understand how the biological brain works in order to de- sign an artificial intelligence (AI), Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published the first concept of a simplified brain cell, the so-called McCulloch-Pitts (MCP) neuron, in 1943 (A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity by W. S. McCulloch and W. Pitts, Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5(4): 115-133, 1943).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 48, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Only a few years later, Frank Rosenblatt published the first concept of the perceptron learning rule based on the MCP neuron model (The Perceptron: A Perceiving and Recognizing Automaton by F. Rosenblatt, Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, 1957). With his perceptron rule, Rosenblatt proposed an algorithm that would automatically learn the optimal weight coefficients that would then be multiplied with the input features in order to make the decision of whether a neuron fires (transmits a signal) or not. In the context of supervised learning and classification, such an algorithm could then be used to predict whether a new data point belongs to one class or the other. The formal definition of an artificial neuron More formally, we can put the idea behind artificial neurons into the context of a binary classifica- tion task with two classes: 0 and 1. We can then define a decision function, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e, that takes a linear combination of certain input values, x, and a corresponding weight vector, w, where z is the so-called net input z = w1x1 + w2x2 + ... + wmxm: \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641 \u22ee \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a ] , \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 \u22ee \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a ] Now, if the net input of a particular example, x (i), is greater than a defined threshold, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03, we predict class 1, and class 0 otherwise. In the perceptron algorithm, the decision function, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u2219), is a variant of a unit step function: \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e1 if \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 0 otherwise", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 49, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For example, assume we have the following two column vectors: \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e3 ] , \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f1 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f2 \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f3 ] Then, we can write the transpose of vector a as a T = [a1 a2 a3] and write the dot product as \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1 \u2219\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f1 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e2 \u2219\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f2 + \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e3 \u2219\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f3 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Furthermore, the transpose operation can also be applied to matrices to reflect it over its diagonal, for example: [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 = [1 3 5 2 4 6] Please note that the transpose operation is strictly only defined for matrices; however, in the context of machine learning, we refer to n \u00d7 1 or 1 \u00d7 m matrices when we use the term \u201cvector.\u201d In this book, we will only use very basic concepts from linear algebra; however, if you need a quick refresher, please take a look at Zico Kolter\u2019s excellent Linear Algebra Review and Reference, which is freely available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/ linalg/linalg_notes.pdf.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 50, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Technically, we could initialize the weights to zero (in fact, this is done in the original perceptron al- gorithm). However, if we did that, then the learning rate \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02 (eta) would have no effect on the decision boundary. If all the weights are initialized to zero, the learning rate parameter, eta, affects only the scale of the weight vector, not the direction. If you are familiar with trigonometry, consider a vector, v1 =[1 2 3], where the angle between v1 and a vector, v2 = 0.5 \u00d7 v1, would be exactly zero, as demon- strated by the following code snippet: >>> v1 = np.array([1, 2, 3]) >>> v2 = 0.5 * v1 >>> np.arccos(v1.dot(v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * ... np.linalg.norm(v2))) 0.0 Here, np.arccos is the trigonometric inverse cosine, and np.linalg.norm is a function that computes the length of a vector. (Our decision to draw the random numbers from a random normal distribu- tion\u2014for example, instead of from a uniform distribution\u2014and to use a standard deviation of 0.01 was arbitrary; remember, we are just interested in small random values to avoid the properties of all-zero vectors, as discussed earlier.) As an optional exercise after reading this chapter, you can change self.w_ = rgen.normal(loc=0.0, scale=0.01, size=X.shape[1]) to self.w_ = np.zeros(X.shape[1]) and run the perceptron train- ing code presented in the next section with different values for eta. You will observe that the decision boundary does not change. NumPy array indexing NumPy indexing for one-dimensional arrays works similarly to Python lists using the square-bracket ([]) notation. For two-dimensional arrays, the first indexer refers to the row number and the second indexer to the column number. For example, we would use X[2, 3] to select the third row and fourth column of a two-dimensional array, X.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 57, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The class labels are predicted by the predict method, which is called in the fit method during training to get the class label for the weight update; but predict can also be used to predict the class labels of new data after we have fitted our model. Furthermore, we also collect the number of mis- classifications during each epoch in the self.errors_ list so that we can later analyze how well our perceptron performed during the training. The np.dot function that is used in the net_input method simply calculates the vector dot product, w Tx + b. Training a perceptron model on the Iris dataset To test our perceptron implementation, we will restrict the following analyses and examples in the remainder of this chapter to two feature variables (dimensions). Although the perceptron rule is not restricted to two dimensions, considering only two features, sepal length and petal length, will allow us to visualize the decision regions of the trained model in a scatterplot for learning purposes. Note that we will also only consider two flower classes, setosa and versicolor, from the Iris dataset for practical reasons\u2014remember, the perceptron is a binary classifier. However, the perceptron algorithm can be extended to multi-class classification\u2014for example, the one-versus-all (OvA) technique. Vectorization: Replacing for loops with vectorized code Instead of using NumPy to calculate the vector dot product between two arrays, a and b, via a.dot(b) or np.dot(a, b), we could also perform the calculation in pure Python via sum([i * j for i, j in zip(a, b)]). However, the advantage of using NumPy over classic Python for loop structures is that its arithmetic operations are vectorized. Vectorization means that an elemental arithmetic operation is automatically applied to all elements in an array. By formulating our arithmetic operations as a sequence of in- structions on an array, rather than performing a set of operations for each element at a time, we can make better use of our modern central processing unit (CPU) architectures with single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) support. Furthermore, NumPy uses highly optimized linear algebra libraries, such as Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) and Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK), that have been written in C or Fortran. Lastly, NumPy also allows us to write our code in a more compact and intuitive way using the basics of linear algebra, such as vector and matrix dot products.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 58, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Adaptive linear neurons and the convergence of learning In this section, we will take a look at another type of single-layer neural network (NN): ADAptive LInear NEuron (Adaline). Adaline was published by Bernard Widrow and his doctoral student Tedd Hoff only a few years after Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron algorithm, and it can be considered an improvement on the latter (An Adaptive \u201cAdaline\u201d Neuron Using Chemical \u201cMemistors\u201d, Technical Report Number 1553-2 by B. Widrow and colleagues, Stanford Electron Labs, Stanford, CA, October 1960). Perceptron convergence Although the perceptron classified the two Iris flower classes perfectly, convergence is one of the biggest problems of the perceptron. Rosenblatt proved mathematically that the perceptron learning rule converges if the two classes can be separated by a linear hy- perplane. However, if the classes cannot be separated perfectly by such a linear decision boundary, the weights will never stop updating unless we set a maximum number of ep- ochs.

This lays the groundwork for understanding other machine learning algorithms for classification, such as logistic regression, support vector machines, and mul- tilayer neural networks, as well as linear regression models, which we will discuss in future chapters. The key difference between the Adaline rule (also known as the Widrow-Hoff rule) and Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron is that the weights are updated based on a linear activation function rather than a unit step function like in the perceptron. In Adaline, this linear activation function, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67), is simply the identity function of the net input, so that \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 . While the linear activation function is used for learning the weights, we still use a threshold function to make the final prediction, which is similar to the unit step function that we covered earlier.

In contrast, the perceptron compares the true class labels to the predicted class labels. Minimizing loss functions with gradient descent One of the key ingredients of supervised machine learning algorithms is a defined objective function that is to be optimized during the learning process. This objective function is often a loss or cost function that we want to minimize. In the case of Adaline, we can define the loss function, L, to learn the model parameters as the mean squared error (MSE) between the calculated outcome and the true class label: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98) = 1 2\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\u2211(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56))) 2 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 The term 1 2 is just added for our convenience and will make it easier to derive the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weight parameters, as we will see in the following paragraphs. The main advantage of this continuous linear activation function, in contrast to the unit step function, is that the loss function becomes differentiable. Another nice property of this loss function is that it is convex; thus, we can use a very simple yet powerful optimization algorithm called gradient descent to find the weights that minimize our loss function to classify the examples in the Iris dataset. As illustrated in Figure 2.10, we can describe the main idea behind gradient descent as climbing down a hill until a local or global loss minimum is reached. In each iteration, we take a step in the opposite direction of the gradient, where the step size is determined by the value of the learning rate, as well as the slope of the gradient (for simplicity, the following figure visualizes this only for a single weight, w): Figure 2.10: How gradient descent works Using gradient descent, we can now update the model parameters by taking a step in the opposite direction of the gradient, \u2207\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f, of our loss function, L(w, b): \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 66, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Here, we added the activation function (computed via the activation method) to illustrate the general concept with regard to how information flows through a single-layer NN: features from the input data, net input, activation, and output. In the next chapter, we will learn about a logistic regression classifier that uses a non-identity, nonlin- ear activation function. We will see that a logistic regression model is closely related to Adaline, with the only difference being its activation and loss function. Now, similar to the previous perceptron implementation, we collect the loss values in a self.losses_ list to check whether the algorithm converged after training. Matrix multiplication Performing a matrix multiplication is similar to calculating a vector dot-product where each row in the matrix is treated as a single row vector. This vectorized approach represents a more compact notation and results in a more efficient computation using NumPy. For example: [1 2 3 4 5 6] \u00d7 [ 7 8 9 ] = [1 \u00d7 7 + 2 \u00d7 8 + 3 \u00d7 9 4 \u00d7 7 + 5 \u00d7 8 + 6 \u00d7 9] = [ 50 122] Please note that in the preceding equation, we are multiplying a matrix with a vector, which is mathematically not defined.

In this section, we will use a feature scaling method called standardization. This normalization procedure helps gradient descent learning to converge more quickly; however, it does not make the original dataset normally distributed. Standardization shifts the mean of each feature so that it is centered at zero and each feature has a standard deviation of 1 (unit variance). For instance, to standardize the jth feature, we can simply subtract the sample mean, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57, from every training example and divide it by its standard deviation, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57: \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 \u2032 = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 Here, xj is a vector consisting of the jth feature values of all training examples, n, and this standard- ization technique is applied to each feature, j, in our dataset. One of the reasons why standardization helps with gradient descent learning is that it is easier to find a learning rate that works well for all weights (and the bias). If the features are on vastly different scales, a learning rate that works well for updating one weight might be too large or too small to update the other weight equally well. Overall, using standardized features can stabilize the training such that the optimizer has to go through fewer steps to find a good or optimal solution (the global loss minimum). Figure 2.13 illustrates possible gradient updates with unscaled features (left) and standardized features (right), where the concentric circles represent the loss surface as a function of two model weights in a two-dimensional classification problem: Figure 2.13: A comparison of unscaled and standardized features on gradient updates Standardization can easily be achieved by using the built-in NumPy methods mean and std: >>> X_std = np.copy(X) >>> X_std[:,0] = (X[:,0] - X[:,0].mean()) / X[:,0].std() >>> X_std[:,1] = (X[:,1] - X[:,1].mean()) / X[:,1].std() After standardization, we will train Adaline again and see that it now converges after a small number of epochs using a learning rate of \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02: >>> ada_gd = AdalineGD(n_iter=20, eta=0.5) >>> ada_gd.fit(X_std, y)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 73, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, note that the MSE remains non-zero even though all flower examples were classified correctly. Large-scale machine learning and stochastic gradient descent In the previous section, we learned how to minimize a loss function by taking a step in the opposite direction of the loss gradient that is calculated from the whole training dataset; this is why this approach is sometimes also referred to as full batch gradient descent. Now imagine that we have a very large dataset with millions of data points, which is not uncommon in many machine learning applications. Running full batch gradient descent can be computationally quite costly in such scenarios, since we need to reevaluate the whole training dataset each time we take one step toward the global minimum.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 74, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Since each gradient is calculated based on a single training example, the error surface is noisier than in gradient descent, which can also have the advantage that SGD can escape shallow local minima more readily if we are working with nonlinear loss functions, as we will see later in Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch. To obtain satisfying results via SGD, it is important to present training data in a random order; also, we want to shuffle the training dataset for every epoch to prevent cycles. Another advantage of SGD is that we can use it for online learning. In online learning, our model is trained on the fly as new training data arrives. This is especially useful if we are accumulating large amounts of data, for example, customer data in web applications. Using online learning, the system can immediately adapt to changes, and the training data can be discarded after updating the model if storage space is an issue. Adjusting the learning rate during training In SGD implementations, the fixed learning rate, \ud835\udf02\ud835\udf02, is often replaced by an adaptive learning rate that decreases over time, for example: \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc501 [number of iterations] + \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc502 where c1 and c2 are constants. Note that SGD does not reach the global loss minimum but an area very close to it. And using an adaptive learning rate, we can achieve further annealing to the loss minimum.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 75, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Mini-batch gradient descent A compromise between full batch gradient descent and SGD is so-called mini-batch gradi- ent descent. Mini-batch gradient descent can be understood as applying full batch gradient descent to smaller subsets of the training data, for example, 32 training examples at a time. The advantage over full batch gradient descent is that convergence is reached faster via mini-batches because of the more frequent weight updates.

Summary In this chapter, we gained a good understanding of the basic concepts of linear classifiers for super- vised learning. After we implemented a perceptron, we saw how we can train adaptive linear neurons efficiently via a vectorized implementation of gradient descent and online learning via SGD. Now that we have seen how to implement simple classifiers in Python, we are ready to move on to the next chapter, where we will use the Python scikit-learn machine learning library to get access to more advanced and powerful machine learning classifiers, which are commonly used in academia as well as in industry. The object-oriented approach that we used to implement the perceptron and Adaline algorithms will help with understanding the scikit-learn API, which is implemented based on the same core concepts that we used in this chapter: the fit and predict methods.

The five main steps that are involved in training a supervised machine learning algorithm can be summarized as follows: 1. Selecting features and collecting labeled training examples 2. Choosing a performance metric 3. Choosing a learning algorithm and training a model 4. Evaluating the performance of the model 5. Changing the settings of the algorithm and tuning the model. Since the approach of this book is to build machine learning knowledge step by step, we will mainly focus on the main concepts of the different algorithms in this chapter and revisit topics such as feature selection and preprocessing, performance metrics, and hyperparameter tuning for more detailed discussions later in the book. First steps with scikit-learn \u2013 training a perceptron In Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, you learned about two relat- ed learning algorithms for classification, the perceptron rule and Adaline, which we implemented in Python and NumPy by ourselves. Now we will take a look at the scikit-learn API, which, as mentioned, combines a user-friendly and consistent interface with a highly optimized implementation of several classification algorithms. The scikit-learn library offers not only a large variety of learning algorithms, but also many convenient functions to preprocess data and to fine-tune and evaluate our models. We will discuss this in more detail, together with the underlying concepts, in Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets \u2013 Data Preprocessing, and Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. To get started with the scikit-learn library, we will train a perceptron model similar to the one that we implemented in Chapter 2. For simplicity, we will use the already familiar Iris dataset throughout the following sections. Conveniently, the Iris dataset is already available via scikit-learn, since it is a simple yet popular dataset that is frequently used for testing and experimenting with algorithms. Similar to the previous chapter, we will only use two features from the Iris dataset for visualization purposes. We will assign the petal length and petal width of the 150 flower examples to the feature matrix, X, and the corresponding class labels of the flower species to the vector array, y: >>> from sklearn import datasets >>> import numpy as np >>> iris = datasets.load_iris() >>> X = iris.data[:, [2, 3]] >>> y = iris.target", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 83, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Although many scikit-learn functions and class methods also work with class labels in string format, using integer labels is a recommended approach to avoid technical glitches and improve computational performance due to a smaller memory footprint; furthermore, encoding class labels as integers is a common convention among most machine learning libraries. To evaluate how well a trained model performs on unseen data, we will further split the dataset into separate training and test datasets. In Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hy- perparameter Tuning, we will discuss the best practices around model evaluation in more detail. Using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn\u2019s model_selection module, we randomly split the X and y arrays into 30 percent test data (45 examples) and 70 percent training data (105 examples): >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split >>> X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( ... X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=1, stratify=y ... ) Note that the train_test_split function already shuffles the training datasets internally before split- ting; otherwise, all examples from class 0 and class 1 would have ended up in the training datasets, and the test dataset would consist of 45 examples from class 2. Via the random_state parameter, we provided a fixed random seed (random_state=1) for the internal pseudo-random number generator that is used for shuffling the datasets prior to splitting. Using such a fixed random_state ensures that our results are reproducible. Lastly, we took advantage of the built-in support for stratification via stratify=y. In this context, stratification means that the train_test_split method returns training and test subsets that have the same proportions of class labels as the input dataset. We can use NumPy\u2019s bincount function, which counts the number of occurrences of each value in an array, to verify that this is indeed the case: >>> print('Labels counts in y:', np.bincount(y)) Labels counts in y: [50 50 50] >>> print('Labels counts in y_train:', np.bincount(y_train)) Labels counts in y_train: [35 35 35] >>> print('Labels counts in y_test:', np.bincount(y_test)) Labels counts in y_test: [15 15 15]", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 84, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Here, we will standardize the features using the StandardScaler class from scikit-learn\u2019s preprocessing module: >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler >>> sc = StandardScaler() >>> sc.fit(X_train) >>> X_train_std = sc.transform(X_train) >>> X_test_std = sc.transform(X_test) Using the preceding code, we loaded the StandardScaler class from the preprocessing module and initialized a new StandardScaler object that we assigned to the sc variable. Using the fit method, StandardScaler estimated the parameters, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 (sample mean) and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e (standard deviation), for each feature dimension from the training data. By calling the transform method, we then standardized the training data using those estimated parameters, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e . Note that we used the same scaling parameters to standardize the test dataset so that both the values in the training and test dataset are comparable with one another. Having standardized the training data, we can now train a perceptron model. Most algorithms in scikit-learn already support multiclass classification by default via the one-versus-rest (OvR) method, which allows us to feed the three flower classes to the perceptron all at once. The code is as follows: >>> from sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron >>> ppn = Perceptron(eta0=0.1, random_state=1) >>> ppn.fit(X_train_std, y_train) The scikit-learn interface will remind you of our perceptron implementation in Chapter 2. After load- ing the Perceptron class from the linear_model module, we initialized a new Perceptron object and trained the model via the fit method. Here, the model parameter, eta0, is equivalent to the learning rate, eta, that we used in our own perceptron implementation. As you will remember from Chapter 2, finding an appropriate learning rate requires some experimen- tation. If the learning rate is too large, the algorithm will overshoot the global loss minimum. If the learning rate is too small, the algorithm will require more epochs until convergence, which can make the learning slow\u2014especially for large datasets. Also, we used the random_state parameter to ensure the reproducibility of the initial shuffling of the training dataset after each epoch. Having trained a model in scikit-learn, we can make predictions via the predict method, just like in our own perceptron implementation in Chapter 2. The code is as follows: >>> y_pred = ppn.predict(X_test_std) >>> print('Misclassified examples: %d' % (y_test != y_pred).sum()) Misclassified examples: 1 Executing the code, we can see that the perceptron misclassifies 1 out of the 45 flower examples.

Alter- natively, each classifier in scikit-learn has a score method, which computes a classifier\u2019s prediction accuracy by combining the predict call with accuracy_score, as shown here: >>> print('Accuracy: %.3f' % ppn.score(X_test_std, y_test)) Accuracy: 0.978 Finally, we can use our plot_decision_regions function from Chapter 2 to plot the decision regions of our newly trained perceptron model and visualize how well it separates the different flower exam- ples. However, let\u2019s add a small modification to highlight the data instances from the test dataset via small circles: from matplotlib.colors import ListedColormap import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def plot_decision_regions(X, y, classifier, test_idx=None, resolution=0.02): # setup marker generator and color map markers = ('o', 's', '^', 'v', '<') colors = ('red', 'blue', 'lightgreen', 'gray', 'cyan') cmap = ListedColormap(colors[:len(np.unique(y))]) Classification error versus accuracy Instead of the misclassification error, many machine learning practitioners report the classification accuracy of a model, which is simply calculated as follows: 1\u2013error = 0.978, or 97.8 percent Whether we use the classification error or accuracy is merely a matter of preference. Overfitting Note that we will evaluate the performance of our models based on the test dataset in this chapter. In Chapter 6, you will learn about useful techniques, including graphical analysis, such as learning curves, to detect and prevent overfitting. Overfitting, which we will return to later in this chapter, means that the model captures the patterns in the training data well but fails to generalize well to unseen data.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 86, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In the following sections, we will look at more powerful linear classifiers that converge to a loss minimum even if the classes are not perfectly linearly separable. Modeling class probabilities via logistic regression Although the perceptron rule offers a nice and easy-going introduction to machine learning algorithms for classification, its biggest disadvantage is that it never converges if the classes are not perfectly lin- early separable. The classification task in the previous section would be an example of such a scenario. The reason for this is that the weights are continuously being updated since there is always at least one misclassified training example present in each epoch. Of course, you can change the learning rate and increase the number of epochs, but be warned that the perceptron will never converge on this dataset. To make better use of our time, we will now take a look at another simple, yet more powerful, algo- rithm for linear and binary classification problems: logistic regression. Note that, despite its name, logistic regression is a model for classification, not regression. Additional perceptron settings The Perceptron, as well as other scikit-learn functions and classes, often has additional parameters that we omit for clarity.

It is one of the most widely used algorithms for classification in industry. Similar to the perceptron and Adaline, the logistic regression model in this chapter is also a linear model for binary classification. To explain the main mechanics behind logistic regression as a probabilistic model for binary classi- fication, let\u2019s first introduce the odds: the odds in favor of a particular event. The odds can be written as \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (1\u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) , where p stands for the probability of the positive event. The term \u201cpositive event\u201d does not necessarily mean \u201cgood,\u201d but refers to the event that we want to predict, for example, the probability that a patient has a certain disease given certain symptoms; we can think of the positive event as class label y = 1 and the symptoms as features x. Hence, for brevity, we can define the probability p as p := p(y = 1|x), the conditional probability that a particular example belongs to a certain class 1 given its features, x. We can then further define the logit function, which is simply the logarithm of the odds (log-odds): logit(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) = log \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d (1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) Note that log refers to the natural logarithm, as it is the common convention in computer science. The logit function takes input values in the range 0 to 1 and transforms them into values over the entire real-number range. Under the logistic model, we assume that there is a linear relationship between the weighted inputs (referred to as net inputs in Chapter 2) and the log-odds: logit(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 + \u22ef+ \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a+ \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57+ \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99 While the preceding describes an assumption we make about the linear relationship between the log-odds and the net inputs, what we are actually interested in is the probability p, the class-member- ship probability of an example given its features. While the logit function maps the probability to a real-number range, we can consider the inverse of this function to map the real-number range back to a [0, 1] range for the probability p. Logistic regression for multiple classes Note that logistic regression can be readily generalized to multiclass settings, which is known as multinomial logistic regression, or softmax regression. More detailed coverage of multinomial logistic regression is outside the scope of this book, but the interested read- er can find more information in my lecture notes at https://sebastianraschka.com/ pdf/lecture-notes/stat453ss21/L08_logistic__slides.pdf or https://youtu. be/L0FU8NFpx4E.

Thus, we can conclude that this sigmoid function takes real-number values as input and transforms them into values in the range [0, 1] with an intercept at \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(0) = 0.5 . To build some understanding of the logistic regression model, we can relate it to Chapter 2. In Adaline, we used the identity function, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 , as the activation function.

The difference between Adaline and logistic regression is illustrated in the following figure, where the only difference is the activation function: Figure 3.3: Logistic regression compared to Adaline The output of the sigmoid function is then interpreted as the probability of a particular ex- ample belonging to class 1, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99), given its features, x, and parameterized by the weights and bias, w and b. For example, if we compute \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 0.8 for a particular flow- er example, it means that the chance that this example is an Iris-versicolor flower is 80 per- cent. Therefore, the probability that this flower is an Iris-setosa flower can be calculated as p(y = 0|x; w, b) = 1 \u2013 p(y = 1|x; w, b) = 0.2, or 20 percent.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 91, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Logistic regression is used in weather forecasting, for example, not only to predict whether it will rain on a particular day, but also to report the chance of rain. Similarly, logistic regression can be used to predict the chance that a patient has a particular disease given certain symptoms, which is why logistic regression enjoys great popularity in the field of medicine. Learning the model weights via the logistic loss function You have learned how we can use the logistic regression model to predict probabilities and class labels; now, let\u2019s briefly talk about how we fit the parameters of the model, for instance, the weights and bias unit, w and b.

Now, let\u2019s learn how to use scikit-learn\u2019s more optimized implementation of logistic regression, which also supports multiclass settings off the shelf. Note that in recent versions of scikit-learn, the technique used for multiclass classification, multinomial, or OvR, is chosen automatically. In the following code example, we will use the sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression class as well as the familiar fit method to train the model on all three classes in the standardized flower training dataset. Also, we set multi_class='ovr' for illustration purposes. As an exercise for the reader, you may want to compare the results with multi_class='multinomial'.

For minimizing convex loss functions, such as the logistic regression loss, it is recommended to use more advanced approaches than regular stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In fact, scikit-learn implements a whole range of such optimization algorithms, which can be specified via the solver parameter, namely, 'newton-cg', 'lbfgs', 'liblinear', 'sag', and 'saga'. While the logistic regression loss is convex, most optimization algorithms should converge to the global loss minimum with ease. However, there are certain advantages of using one algorithm over the other. For example, in previous versions (for instance, v 0.21), scikit-learn used 'liblinear' as a default, which cannot handle the multinomial loss and is limited to the OvR scheme for multiclass classification.

However, before we move on to those topics, let\u2019s finish our discussion of class membership probabilities. The probability that training examples belong to a certain class can be computed using the predict_ proba method. For example, we can predict the probabilities of the first three examples in the test dataset as follows: >>> lr.predict_proba(X_test_std[:3, :]) This code snippet returns the following array: array([[3.81527885e-09, 1.44792866e-01, 8.55207131e-01], [8.34020679e-01, 1.65979321e-01, 3.25737138e-13], [8.48831425e-01, 1.51168575e-01, 2.62277619e-14]]) The first row corresponds to the class membership probabilities of the first flower, the second row corresponds to the class membership probabilities of the second flower, and so forth. Notice that the column-wise sum in each row is 1, as expected. (You can confirm this by executing lr.predict_ proba(X_test_std[:3, :]).sum(axis=1).) The highest value in the first row is approximately 0.85, which means that the first example belongs to class 3 (Iris-virginica) with a predicted probability of 85 percent. So, as you may have already noticed, we can get the predicted class labels by identifying the largest column in each row, for ex- ample, using NumPy\u2019s argmax function: >>> lr.predict_proba(X_test_std[:3, :]).argmax(axis=1) The returned class indices are shown here (they correspond to Iris-virginica, Iris-setosa, and Iris-setosa): array([2, 0, 0]) In the preceding code example, we computed the conditional probabilities and converted these into class labels manually by using NumPy\u2019s argmax function. In practice, the more convenient way of obtaining class labels when using scikit-learn is to call the predict method directly: >>> lr.predict(X_test_std[:3, :]) array([2, 0, 0]) Lastly, a word of caution if you want to predict the class label of a single flower example: scikit-learn expects a two-dimensional array as data input; thus, we have to convert a single row slice into such a format first. One way to convert a single row entry into a two-dimensional data array is to use NumPy\u2019s reshape method to add a new dimension, as demonstrated here: >>> lr.predict(X_test_std[0, :].reshape(1, -1)) array([2])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 101, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

If a model suffers from overfitting, we also say that the model has a high variance, which can be caused by having too many parameters, leading to a model that is too complex given the underlying data. Similarly, our model can also suffer from underfitting (high bias), which means that our model is not complex enough to capture the pattern in the training data well and therefore also suffers from low performance on unseen data. Although we have only encountered linear models for classification so far, the problems of overfitting and underfitting can be best illustrated by comparing a linear decision boundary to more complex, nonlinear decision boundaries, as shown in Figure 3.8: Figure 3.8: Examples of underfitted, well-fitted, and overfitted models The bias-variance tradeoff Often, researchers use the terms \u201cbias\u201d and \u201cvariance\u201d or \u201cbias-variance tradeoff\u201d to de- scribe the performance of a model\u2014that is, you may stumble upon talks, books, or articles where people say that a model has a \u201chigh variance\u201d or \u201chigh bias.\u201d So, what does that mean? In general, we might say that \u201chigh variance\u201d is proportional to overfitting and \u201chigh bias\u201d is proportional to underfitting. In the context of machine learning models, variance measures the consistency (or vari- ability) of the model prediction for classifying a particular example if we retrain the model multiple times, for example, on different subsets of the training dataset. We can say that the model is sensitive to the randomness in the training data. In contrast, bias measures how far off the predictions are from the correct values in general if we rebuild the model multiple times on different training datasets; bias is the measure of the systematic error that is not due to randomness. If you are interested in the technical specification and derivation of the \u201cbias\u201d and \u201cvariance\u201d terms, I\u2019ve written about it in my lecture notes here: https://sebastianraschka.com/ pdf/lecture-notes/stat451fs20/08-model-eval-1-intro__notes.pdf.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 102, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The concept behind regularization is to introduce additional information to penalize extreme parameter (weight) values.

The reason is that we have to be careful when adjusting the regular- ization strength. For instance, if the regularization strength is too high and the weights coefficients approach zero, the model can perform very poorly due to underfitting, as illustrated in Figure 3.8. Maximum margin classification with support vector machines Another powerful and widely used learning algorithm is the support vector machine (SVM), which can be considered an extension of the perceptron. Using the perceptron algorithm, we minimized misclassification errors. However, in SVMs, our optimization objective is to maximize the margin.

Let\u2019s start with the definition of entropy for all non-empty classes (\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \u22600): \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \u2212\u2211\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) log2 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56|\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Here, p(i|t) is the proportion of the examples that belong to class i for a particular node, t. The entropy is therefore 0 if all examples at a node belong to the same class, and the entropy is maximal if we have a uniform class distribution. For example, in a binary class setting, the entropy is 0 if p(i=1|t) = 1 or p(i=0|t) = 0. If the classes are distributed uniformly with p(i=1|t) = 0.5 and p(i=0|t) = 0.5, the entropy is 1. Therefore, we can say that the entropy criterion attempts to maximize the mutual information in the tree. To provide a visual intuition, let us visualize the entropy values for different class distributions via the following code: >>> def entropy(p): ... return - p * np.log2(p) - (1 - p) * np.log2((1 - p)) >>> x = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.01) >>> ent = [entropy(p) if p != 0 else None for p in x] >>> plt.ylabel('Entropy') >>> plt.xlabel('Class-membership probability p(i=1)') >>> plt.plot(x, ent) >>> plt.show()", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 117, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The first split uses a sepal width cut- off \u2264 0.75 cm for splitting the root node into two child nodes with 35 examples (left child node) and 70 examples (right child node). After the first split, we can see that the left child node is already pure and only contains examples from the Iris-setosa class (Gini impurity = 0). The further splits on the right are then used to separate the examples from the Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica class. Looking at this tree, and the decision region plot of the tree, we can see that the decision tree does a very good job of separating the flower classes. Unfortunately, scikit-learn currently does not implement functionality to manually post-prune a decision tree. However, we could go back to our previous code example, change the max_depth of our decision tree to 3, and compare it to our current model, but we leave this as an exercise for the interested reader. Alternatively, scikit-learn provides an automatic cost complexity post-pruning procedure for decision trees. Interested readers can find more information about this more advanced topic in the following tutorial: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/tree/plot_cost_complexity_pruning. html. Combining multiple decision trees via random forests Ensemble methods have gained huge popularity in applications of machine learning during the last decade due to their good classification performance and robustness toward overfitting. While we are going to cover different ensemble methods, including bagging and boosting, later in Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning, let\u2019s discuss the decision tree-based random forest algorithm, which is known for its good scalability and ease of use. A random forest can be considered as an ensemble of decision trees. The idea behind a random forest is to average multiple (deep) deci- sion trees that individually suffer from high variance to build a more robust model that has a better generalization performance and is less susceptible to overfitting. The random forest algorithm can be summarized in four simple steps: 1. Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n examples from the training dataset with replacement). 2. Grow a decision tree from the bootstrap sample. At each node: a. Randomly select d features without replacement. b. Split the node using the feature that provides the best split according to the objective function, for instance, maximizing the information gain. 3. Repeat steps 1-2 k times. 4. Aggregate the prediction by each tree to assign the class label by majority vote. Majority voting will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 124, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Although random forests don\u2019t offer the same level of interpretability as decision trees, a big advantage of random forests is that we don\u2019t have to worry so much about choosing good hyperparameter values. We typically don\u2019t need to prune the random forest since the ensemble model is quite robust to noise from averaging the predictions among the individual decision trees. The only parameter that we need to care about in practice is the number of trees, k, (step 3) that we choose for the random forest. Typically, the larger the number of trees, the better the performance of the random forest classifier at the expense of an increased computational cost. Sampling with and without replacement In case you are not familiar with the terms sampling \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d replacement, let\u2019s walk through a simple thought experiment. Let\u2019s assume that we are playing a lottery game where we randomly draw numbers from an urn. We start with an urn that holds five unique numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and we draw exactly one number on each turn. In the first round, the chance of drawing a particular number from the urn would be 1/5. Now, in sampling without replacement, we do not put the number back into the urn after each turn. Consequently, the probability of drawing a particular number from the set of remaining numbers in the next round depends on the previous round. For example, if we have a remaining set of numbers 0, 1, 2, and 4, the chance of drawing number 0 would become 1/4 in the next turn. However, in random sampling with replacement, we always return the drawn number to the urn so that the probability of drawing a particular number at each turn does not change; we can draw the same number more than once. In other words, in sampling with replacement, the samples (numbers) are independent and have a covariance of zero. For example, the results from five rounds of drawing random numbers could look like this: \u2022 Random sampling without replacement: 2, 1, 3, 4, 0 \u2022 Random sampling with replacement: 1, 3, 3, 4, 1", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 125, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Via the sample size, n, of the bootstrap sample, we control the bias-variance tradeoff of the random forest. Decreasing the size of the bootstrap sample increases the diversity among the individual trees since the probability that a particular training example is included in the bootstrap sample is lower. Thus, shrinking the size of the bootstrap samples may increase the randomness of the random forest, and it can help to reduce the effect of overfitting. However, smaller bootstrap samples typically result in a lower overall performance of the random forest and a small gap between training and test performance, but a low test performance overall. Conversely, increasing the size of the bootstrap sample may increase the degree of overfitting. Because the bootstrap samples, and consequently the individual decision trees, become more similar to one another, they learn to fit the original training dataset more closely. In most implementations, including the RandomForestClassifier implementation in scikit-learn, the size of the bootstrap sample is chosen to be equal to the number of training examples in the original training dataset, which usually provides a good bias-variance tradeoff. For the number of features, d, at each split, we want to choose a value that is smaller than the total number of features in the training dataset. A reasonable default that is used in scikit-learn and other implementations is \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u221a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a , where m is the number of features in the training dataset.

Typical examples of parametric models are the perceptron, logistic regression, and the linear SVM.

By executing the following code, we will now implement a KNN model in scikit-learn using a Euclid- ean distance metric: >>> from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier >>> knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=5, p=2, ... metric='minkowski') >>> knn.fit(X_train_std, y_train) >>> plot_decision_regions(X_combined_std, y_combined, ... classifier=knn, test_idx=range(105,150)) >>> plt.xlabel('Petal length [standardized]') >>> plt.ylabel('Petal width [standardized]') >>> plt.legend(loc='upper left') >>> plt.tight_layout() >>> plt.show() Advantages and disadvantages of memory-based approaches The main advantage of such a memory-based approach is that the classifier immediately adapts as we collect new training data. However, the downside is that the computational complexity for classifying new examples grows linearly with the number of examples in the training dataset in the worst-case scenario\u2014unless the dataset has very few dimen- sions (features) and the algorithm has been implemented using efficient data structures for querying the training data more effectively. Such data structures include k-d tree (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) and ball tree (https://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Ball_tree), which are both supported in scikit-learn. Furthermore, next to computational costs for querying data, large datasets can also be problematic in terms of limited storage capacities. However, in many cases when we are working with relatively small to medium-sized data- sets, memory-based methods can provide good predictive and computational performance and are thus a good choice for approaching many real-world problems.

We also have to make sure that we choose a distance metric that is appropriate for the features in the dataset. Often, a simple Euclidean distance measure is used for real-value examples, for example, the flowers in our Iris dataset, which have features measured in centimeters. However, if we are using a Euclidean distance measure, it is also important to standardize the data so that each feature contributes equally to the distance.

DistanceMetric.html. Lastly, it is important to mention that KNN is very susceptible to overfitting due to the curse of dimen- sionality. The curse of dimensionality describes the phenomenon where the feature space becomes increasingly sparse for an increasing number of dimensions of a fixed-size training dataset. We can think of even the closest neighbors as being too far away in a high-dimensional space to give a good estimate. We discussed the concept of regularization in the section about logistic regression as one way to avoid overfitting. However, in models where regularization is not applicable, such as decision trees and KNN, we can use feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques to help us to avoid the curse of dimensionality. This will be discussed in more detail in the next two chapters. Summary In this chapter, you learned about many different machine learning algorithms that are used to tackle linear and nonlinear problems. You have seen that decision trees are particularly attractive if we care about interpretability. Logistic regression is not only a useful model for online learning via SGD, but also allows us to predict the probability of a particular event. Although SVMs are powerful linear models that can be extended to nonlinear problems via the kernel trick, they have many parameters that have to be tuned in order to make good predictions. In contrast, ensemble methods, such as random forests, don\u2019t require much parameter tuning and don\u2019t overfit as easily as decision trees, which makes them attractive models for many practical problem domains. The KNN classifier offers an alternative approach to classification via lazy learning that allows us to make predictions without any model training, but with a more computationally expensive prediction step. Alternative machine learning implementations with GPU support When working with large datasets, running k-nearest neighbors or fitting random forests with many estimators can require substantial computing resources and processing time. If you have a computer equipped with an NVIDIA GPU that is compatible with recent versions of NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA library, we recommend considering the RAPIDS ecosystem (https:// docs.rapids.ai/api). For instance, RAPIDS\u2019 cuML (https://docs.rapids.ai/api/ cuml/stable/) library implements many of scikit-learn\u2019s machine learning algorithms with GPU support to accelerate the processing speeds. You can find an introduction to cuML at https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuml/stable/estimator_intro.html.

There could have been an error in the data collection process, certain mea- surements may not be applicable, or particular fields could have been simply left blank in a survey, for example. We typically see missing values as blank spaces in our data table or as placeholder strings such as NaN, which stands for \u201cnot a number,\u201d or NULL (a commonly used indicator of unknown values in relational databases). Unfortunately, most computational tools are unable to handle such missing values or will produce unpredictable results if we simply ignore them.

The StringIO function in the preceding code example was simply used for the purposes of illustration. It allowed us to read the string assigned to csv_data into a pandas DataFrame as if it was a regular CSV file on our hard drive. For a larger DataFrame, it can be tedious to look for missing values manually; in this case, we can use the isnull method to return a DataFrame with Boolean values that indicate whether a cell contains a numeric value (False) or if data is missing (True). Using the sum method, we can then return the number of missing values per column as follows: >>> df.isnull().sum() A 0 B 0 C 1 D 1 dtype: int64 This way, we can count the number of missing values per column; in the following subsections, we will take a look at different strategies for how to deal with this missing data.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 135, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Nowa- days, most scikit-learn functions support DataFrame objects as inputs, but since NumPy array handling is more mature in the scikit-learn API, it is recommended to use NumPy arrays when possible. Note that you can always access the underlying NumPy array of a DataFrame via the values attribute before you feed it into a scikit-learn estimator: >>> df.values array([[ 1., 2., 3., 4.], [ 5., 6., nan, 8.], [ 10., 11., 12., nan]])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 136, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Or, if we remove too many feature columns, we will run the risk of losing valuable information that our classifier needs to discriminate between classes. In the next section, we will look at one of the most commonly used alternatives for dealing with missing values: interpolation techniques. Imputing missing values Often, the removal of training examples or dropping of entire feature columns is simply not feasible, because we might lose too much valuable data. In this case, we can use different interpolation tech- niques to estimate the missing values from the other training examples in our dataset. One of the most common interpolation techniques is mean imputation, where we simply replace the missing value with the mean value of the entire feature column. A convenient way to achieve this is by using the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn, as shown in the following code: >>> from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer >>> import numpy as np >>> imr = SimpleImputer(missing_values=np.nan, strategy='mean') >>> imr = imr.fit(df.values) >>> imputed_data = imr.transform(df.values) >>> imputed_data array([[ 1., 2., 3., 4.], [ 5., 6., 7.5, 8.], [ 10., 11., 12., 6.]]) Here, we replaced each NaN value with the corresponding mean, which is separately calculated for each feature column. Other options for the strategy parameter are median or most_frequent, where the latter replaces the missing values with the most frequent values. This is useful for imputing cate- gorical feature values, for example, a feature column that stores an encoding of color names, such as red, green, and blue. We will encounter examples of such data later in this chapter.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 137, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For example, using pandas, we could achieve the same mean imputation directly in the DataFrame object via the following command: >>> df.fillna(df.mean()) Figure 4.1: Replacing missing values in data with the mean Understanding the scikit-learn estimator API In the previous section, we used the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn to impute missing values in our dataset. The SimpleImputer class is part of the so-called transformer API in scikit-learn, which is used for implementing Python classes related to data transformation. (Please note that the scikit- learn transformer API is not to be confused with the transformer architecture that is used in natural language processing, which we will cover in more detail in Chapter 16, Transformers \u2013 Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms.) The two essential methods of those estimators are fit and transform. The fit method is used to learn the parameters from the training data, and the transform method uses those parameters to transform the data. Any data array that is to be trans- formed needs to have the same number of features as the data array that was used to fit the model.

Estimators have a predict method but can also have a transform method, as you will see later in this chapter. As you may recall, we also used the fit method to learn the parame- ters of a model when we trained those estimators for classification. However, in supervised learning tasks, we additionally provide the class labels for fitting the model, which can then be used to make predictions about new, unlabeled data examples via the predict method, as illustrated in Figure 4.3: Figure 4.3: Using the scikit-learn API for predictive models such as classifiers", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 139, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, it is not uncommon for real-world datasets to contain one or more categorical feature columns. In this section, we will make use of sim- ple yet effective examples to see how to deal with this type of data in numerical computing libraries. When we are talking about categorical data, we have to further distinguish between ordinal and nom- inal features. Ordinal features can be understood as categorical values that can be sorted or ordered. For example, t-shirt size would be an ordinal feature, because we can define an order: XL > L > M. In contrast, nominal features don\u2019t imply any order; to continue with the previous example, we could think of t-shirt color as a nominal feature since it typically doesn\u2019t make sense to say that, for example, red is larger than blue. Categorical data encoding with pandas Before we explore different techniques for handling such categorical data, let\u2019s create a new DataFrame to illustrate the problem: >>> import pandas as pd >>> df = pd.DataFrame([ ... ['green', 'M', 10.1, 'class2'], ... ['red', 'L', 13.5, 'class1'], ... ['blue', 'XL', 15.3, 'class2']]) >>> df.columns = ['color', 'size', 'price', 'classlabel'] >>> df color size price classlabel 0 green M 10.1 class2 1 red L 13.5 class1 2 blue XL 15.3 class2 As we can see in the preceding output, the newly created DataFrame contains a nominal feature (color), an ordinal feature (size), and a numerical feature (price) column. The class labels (assuming that we created a dataset for a supervised learning task) are stored in the last column. The learning algorithms for classification that we discuss in this book do not use ordinal information in class labels. Mapping ordinal features To make sure that the learning algorithm interprets the ordinal features correctly, we need to convert the categorical string values into integers. Unfortunately, there is no convenient function that can automatically derive the correct order of the labels of our size feature, so we have to define the map- ping manually. In the following simple example, let\u2019s assume that we know the numerical difference between features, for example, XL = L + 1 = M + 2: >>> size_mapping = {'XL': 3, ... 'L': 2, ... 'M': 1}", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 140, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We can use it as follows: >>> inv_size_mapping = {v: k for k, v in size_mapping.items()} >>> df['size'].map(inv_size_mapping) 0 M 1 L 2 XL Name: size, dtype: object Encoding class labels Many machine learning libraries require that class labels are encoded as integer values. Although most estimators for classification in scikit-learn convert class labels to integers internally, it is considered good practice to provide class labels as integer arrays to avoid technical glitches. To encode the class labels, we can use an approach similar to the mapping of ordinal features discussed previously. We need to remember that class labels are not ordinal, and it doesn\u2019t matter which integer number we assign to a particular string label. Thus, we can simply enumerate the class labels, starting at 0: >>> import numpy as np >>> class_mapping = {label: idx for idx, label in ... enumerate(np.unique(df['classlabel']))} >>> class_mapping {'class1': 0, 'class2': 1} Next, we can use the mapping dictionary to transform the class labels into integers: >>> df['classlabel'] = df['classlabel'].map(class_mapping) >>> df color size price classlabel 0 green 1 10.1 1 1 red 2 13.5 0 2 blue 3 15.3 1", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 141, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Since scikit-learn\u2019s estimators for classification treat class labels as categorical data that does not imply any order (nominal), we used the convenient LabelEncoder to encode the string labels into integers. We could use a similar approach to transform the nominal color column of our dataset, as follows: >>> X = df[['color', 'size', 'price']].values >>> color_le = LabelEncoder() >>> X[:, 0] = color_le.fit_transform(X[:, 0]) >>> X array([[1, 1, 10.1], [2, 2, 13.5], [0, 3, 15.3]], dtype=object)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 142, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Can you spot the problem? Although the color values don\u2019t come in any particular order, common classification models, such as the ones covered in the previous chapters, will now assume that green is larger than blue, and red is larger than green. Although this assumption is incorrect, a classifier could still produce useful results. However, those results would not be optimal. A common workaround for this problem is to use a technique called one-hot encoding. The idea behind this approach is to create a new dummy feature for each unique value in the nominal feature column. Here, we would convert the color feature into three new features: blue, green, and red. Binary values can then be used to indicate the particular color of an example; for example, a blue example can be encoded as blue=1, green=0, red=0. To perform this transformation, we can use the OneHotEncoder that is implemented in scikit-learn\u2019s preprocessing module: >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder >>> X = df[['color', 'size', 'price']].values >>> color_ohe = OneHotEncoder() >>> color_ohe.fit_transform(X[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)).toarray() array([[0., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1.], [1., 0., 0.]]) Note that we applied the OneHotEncoder to only a single column, (X[:, 0].reshape(-1, 1)), to avoid modifying the other two columns in the array as well. If we want to selectively transform columns in a multi-feature array, we can use the ColumnTransformer, which accepts a list of (name, transformer, column(s)) tuples as follows: >>> from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer >>> X = df[['color', 'size', 'price']].values >>> c_transf = ColumnTransformer([ ... ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(), [0]), ... ('nothing', 'passthrough', [1, 2]) ... ]) >>> c_transf.fit_transform(X).astype(float) array([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1, 10.1], [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2, 13.5], [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 3, 15.3]])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 143, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

An even more convenient way to create those dummy features via one-hot encoding is to use the get_dummies method implemented in pandas. Applied to a DataFrame, the get_dummies method will only convert string columns and leave all other columns unchanged: >>> pd.get_dummies(df[['price', 'color', 'size']]) price size color_blue color_green color_red 0 10.1 1 0 1 0 1 13.5 2 0 0 1 2 15.3 3 1 0 0 When we are using one-hot encoding datasets, we have to keep in mind that this introduces multi- collinearity, which can be an issue for certain methods (for instance, methods that require matrix inversion). If features are highly correlated, matrices are computationally difficult to invert, which can lead to numerically unstable estimates. To reduce the correlation among variables, we can simply remove one feature column from the one-hot encoded array. Note that we do not lose any important information by removing a feature column, though; for example, if we remove the column color_blue, the feature information is still preserved since if we observe color_green=0 and color_red=0, it implies that the observation must be blue. If we use the get_dummies function, we can drop the first column by passing a True argument to the drop_first parameter, as shown in the following code example: >>> pd.get_dummies(df[['price', 'color', 'size']], ... drop_first=True) price size color_green color_red 0 10.1 1 1 0 1 13.5 2 0 1 2 15.3 3 0 0 In order to drop a redundant column via the OneHotEncoder, we need to set drop='first' and set categories='auto' as follows: >>> color_ohe = OneHotEncoder(categories='auto', drop='first') >>> c_transf = ColumnTransformer([ ...

For example, we can split the feature size with values M, L, and XL into two new features, x > M and x > L. Let\u2019s consider the original DataFrame: >>> df = pd.DataFrame([['green', 'M', 10.1, ... 'class2'], ... ['red', 'L', 13.5, ... 'class1'], ... ['blue', 'XL', 15.3, ... 'class2']]) >>> df.columns = ['color', 'size', 'price', ...

Some of these techniques can be useful when working with categorical features that have high cardinality (a large number of unique category labels). Examples include: \u2022 Binary encoding, which produces multiple binary features similar to one-hot encoding but requires fewer feature columns, i.e., log2(K) instead of K \u2013 1, where K is the number of unique categories. In binary encoding, numbers are first con- verted into binary representations, and then each binary number position will form a new feature column. \u2022 Count or frequency encoding, which replaces the label of each category by the number of times or frequency it occurs in the training set. These methods, as well as additional categorical encoding schemes, are available via the scikit-learn-compatible category_encoders library: https://contrib.scikit-learn. org/category_encoders/. While these methods are not guaranteed to perform better than one-hot encoding in terms of model performance, we can consider the choice of a categorical encoding scheme as an additional \u201chyperparameter\u201d for improving model performance.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 145, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Remember that comparing predictions to true labels in the test set can be understood as the unbiased performance evaluation of our model before we let it loose in the real world. In this section, we will prepare a new dataset, the Wine dataset. After we have preprocessed the dataset, we will explore different techniques for feature selection to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. The Wine dataset is another open-source dataset that is available from the UCI machine learning re- pository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine); it consists of 178 wine examples with 13 features describing their different chemical properties.

Providing the class label array y as an argument to stratify ensures that both training and test datasets have the same class proportions as the original dataset. Bringing features onto the same scale Feature scaling is a crucial step in our preprocessing pipeline that can easily be forgotten. Decision trees and random forests are two of the very few machine learning algorithms where we don\u2019t need to worry about feature scaling. Those algorithms are scale-invariant. However, the majority of machine learning and optimization algorithms behave much better if features are on the same scale, as we saw in Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, when we implemented the gradient descent optimization algorithm. The importance of feature scaling can be illustrated by a simple example. Let\u2019s assume that we have two features where one feature is measured on a scale from 1 to 10 and the second feature is measured on a scale from 1 to 100,000, respectively. When we think of the squared error function in Adaline from Chapter 2, it makes sense to say that the algorithm will mostly be busy optimizing the weights according to the larger errors in the second feature. Another example is the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with a Euclidean distance measure: the computed distances between examples will be dominated by the second feature axis. Choosing an appropriate ratio for partitioning a dataset into training and test datasets If we are dividing a dataset into training and test datasets, we have to keep in mind that we are withholding valuable information that the learning algorithm could benefit from. Thus, we don\u2019t want to allocate too much information to the test set. However, the smaller the test set, the more inaccurate the estimation of the generalization error. Dividing a dataset into training and test datasets is all about balancing this tradeoff. In practice, the most commonly used splits are 60:40, 70:30, or 80:20, depending on the size of the initial dataset. However, for large datasets, 90:10 or 99:1 splits are also common and appropriate. For example, if the dataset contains more than 100,000 training examples, it might be fine to withhold only 10,000 examples for testing in order to get a good estimate of the gener- alization performance. More information and illustrations can be found in section one of my article Model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning, which is freely available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf. Also, we will revisit the topic of model evaluation and discuss it in more detail in Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning. Moreover, instead of discarding the allocated test data after model training and evaluation, it is a common practice to retrain a classifier on the entire dataset, as it can improve the predictive performance of the model. While this approach is generally recommended, it could lead to worse generalization performance if the dataset is small and the test dataset contains outliers, for example. Also, after refitting the model on the whole dataset, we don\u2019t have any independent data left to evaluate its performance.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 148, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Those terms are often used quite loosely in different fields, and the meaning has to be derived from the context. Most often, normalization refers to the rescaling of the features to a range of [0, 1], which is a special case of min-max scaling. To normalize our data, we can simply apply the min-max scaling to each feature column, where the new value, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) , of an example, x (i), can be calculated as follows: \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a Here, x (i) is a particular example, xmin is the smallest value in a feature column, and xmax is the largest value. The min-max scaling procedure is implemented in scikit-learn and can be used as follows: >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler >>> mms = MinMaxScaler() >>> X_train_norm = mms.fit_transform(X_train) >>> X_test_norm = mms.transform(X_test) Although normalization via min-max scaling is a commonly used technique that is useful when we need values in a bounded interval, standardization can be more practical for many machine learning algorithms, especially for optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. The reason is that many linear models, such as the logistic regression and SVM from Chapter 3, initialize the weights to 0 or small random values close to 0. Using standardization, we center the feature columns at mean 0 with standard deviation 1 so that the feature columns have the same parameters as a standard normal distribution (zero mean and unit variance), which makes it easier to learn the weights. However, we shall emphasize that standardization does not change the shape of the distribution, and it does not transform non-normally distributed data into normally distributed data. In addition to scaling data such that it has zero mean and unit variance, standardization maintains useful information about outliers and makes the algorithm less sensitive to them in contrast to min-max scaling, which scales the data to a limited range of values. The procedure for standardization can be expressed by the following equation: \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 149, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Other, more advanced methods for feature scaling are available from scikit-learn, such as RobustScaler. RobustScaler is especially helpful and recommended if we are working with small datasets that contain many outliers. Similarly, if the machine learning algorithm applied to this dataset is prone to overfitting, RobustScaler can be a good choice. Operating on each feature column independently, RobustScaler removes the median value and scales the dataset according to the 1st and 3rd quartile of the dataset (that is, the 25th and 75th quantile, respectively) such that more extreme values and outliers become less pronounced. The interested reader can find more information about RobustScaler in the official scikit-learn documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/ sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html. Selecting meaningful features If we notice that a model performs much better on a training dataset than on the test dataset, this ob- servation is a strong indicator of overfitting. As we discussed in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, overfitting means the model fits the parameters too closely with regard to the particular observations in the training dataset but does not generalize well to new data; we say that the model has a high variance. The reason for the overfitting is that our model is too complex for the given training data. Common solutions to reduce the generalization error are as follows: \u2022 Collect more training data \u2022 Introduce a penalty for complexity via regularization \u2022 Choose a simpler model with fewer parameters \u2022 Reduce the dimensionality of the data Collecting more training data is often not applicable. In Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, we will learn about a useful technique to check whether more training data is helpful. In the following sections, we will look at common ways to reduce overfitting by regularization and dimensionality reduction via feature selection, which leads to simpler models by requiring fewer parameters to be fitted to the data. Then, in Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimen- sionality Reduction, we will take a look at additional feature extraction techniques. L1 and L2 regularization as penalties against model complexity You will recall from Chapter 3 that L2 regularization is one approach to reduce the complexity of a model by penalizing large individual weights.

In contrast to L2 regularization, L1 regularization usually yields sparse feature vectors, and most fea- ture weights will be zero. Sparsity can be useful in practice if we have a high-dimensional dataset with many features that are irrelevant, especially in cases where we have more irrelevant dimensions than training examples. In this sense, L1 regularization can be understood as a technique for feature selection. A geometric interpretation of L2 regularization As mentioned in the previous section, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that effectively results in less extreme weight values compared to a model trained with an unregularized loss function. To better understand how L1 regularization encourages sparsity, let\u2019s take a step back and take a look at a geometric interpretation of regularization. Let\u2019s plot the contours of a convex loss function for two weight coefficients, w1 and w2. Here, we will consider the mean squared error (MSE) loss function that we used for Adaline in Chapter 2, which computes the squared distances between the true and predicted class labels, y and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 , aver- aged over all N examples in the training set. Since the MSE is spherical, it is easier to draw than the loss function of logistic regression; however, the same concepts apply. Remember that our goal is to find the combination of weight coefficients that minimize the loss function for the training data, as shown in Figure 4.5 (the point in the center of the ellipses): Figure 4.5: Minimizing the mean squared error loss function", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 152, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Let\u2019s illustrate this concept in the following figure for the L2 penalty term: Figure 4.6: Applying L2 regularization to the loss function The quadratic L2 regularization term is represented by the shaded ball. Here, our weight coefficients cannot exceed our regularization budget\u2014the combination of the weight coefficients cannot fall outside the shaded area.

Under the penalty constraint, our best effort is to choose the point where the L2 ball intersects with the contours of the unpenalized loss function. The larger the value of the regularization parameter, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06, gets, the faster the penalized loss grows, which leads to a narrower L2 ball. For example, if we increase the regularization parameter toward infinity, the weight coefficients will become effectively zero, denoted by the center of the L2 ball.

In the next chapter, Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction, we will learn about different feature extraction techniques to compress a dataset onto a lower-dimensional feature subspace. Sequential feature selection algorithms are a family of greedy search algorithms that are used to reduce an initial d-dimensional feature space to a k-dimensional feature subspace where k<d. The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem, to improve computational efficiency, or to reduce the generalization error of the model by removing irrelevant features or noise, which can be useful for algorithms that don\u2019t support regularization. A classic sequential feature selection algorithm is sequential backward selection (SBS), which aims to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature subspace with a minimum decay in the performance of the classifier to improve upon computational efficiency. In certain cases, SBS can even improve the predictive power of the model if a model suffers from overfitting. The idea behind the SBS algorithm is quite simple: SBS sequentially removes features from the full feature subset until the new feature subspace contains the desired number of features. To determine which feature is to be removed at each stage, we need to define the criterion function, J, that we want to minimize. The criterion calculated by the criterion function can simply be the difference in the performance of the classifier before and after the removal of a particular feature. Then, the feature to be removed at each stage can simply be defined as the feature that maximizes this criterion; or in more simple terms, at each stage we eliminate the feature that causes the least performance loss after removal. Based on the preceding definition of SBS, we can outline the algorithm in four simple steps: 1. Initialize the algorithm with k = d, where d is the dimensionality of the full feature space, Xd. 2. Determine the feature, x \u2013, that maximizes the criterion: x \u2013 = argmax J(Xk \u2013 x), where \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58. 3. Remove the feature, x \u2013, from the feature set: Xk\u20131 = Xk \u2013 x \u2013; k = k \u2013 1. 4. Terminate if k equals the number of desired features; otherwise, go to step 2. Greedy search algorithms Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage of a combinatorial search problem and generally yield a suboptimal solution to the problem, in contrast to exhaustive search algorithms, which evaluate all possible combinations and are guaranteed to find the optimal solution. However, in practice, an exhaustive search is often computationally not feasible, whereas greedy algorithms allow for a less complex, computationally more efficient solution.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 158, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Another useful approach for selecting relevant features from a dataset is using a random forest, an en- semble technique that was introduced in Chapter 3. Using a random forest, we can measure the feature importance as the averaged impurity decrease computed from all decision trees in the forest, without making any assumptions about whether our data is linearly separable or not. Conveniently, the random forest implementation in scikit-learn already collects the feature importance values for us so that we can access them via the feature_importances_ attribute after fitting a RandomForestClassifier. By executing the following code, we will now train a forest of 500 trees on the Wine dataset and rank the 13 features by their respective importance measures\u2014remember from our discussion in Chapter 3 that we don\u2019t need to use standardized or normalized features in tree-based models: >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier >>> feat_labels = df_wine.columns[1:] >>> forest = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=500, ... random_state=1) >>> forest.fit(X_train, y_train) >>> importances = forest.feature_importances_ >>> indices = np.argsort(importances)[::-1] >>> for f in range(X_train.shape[1]): ... print(\"%2d) %-*s %f\" % (f + 1, 30, ... feat_labels[indices[f]], Feature selection algorithms in scikit-learn You can find implementations of several different flavors of sequential feature selec- tion related to the simple SBS that we implemented previously in the Python package mlxtend at http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/feature_selection/ SequentialFeatureSelector/. While our mlxtend implementation comes with many bells and whistles, we collaborated with the scikit-learn team to implement a simplified, user-friendly version, which has been part of the recent v0.24 release. The usage and be- havior are very similar to the SBS code we implemented in this chapter. If you would like to learn more, please see the documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ modules/generated/sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector. html. There are many more feature selection algorithms available via scikit-learn. These include recursive backward elimination based on feature weights, tree-based methods to select features by importance, and univariate statistical tests.

Interestingly, two of the top-ranked features in the plot are also in the three-feature subset selection from the SBS algorithm that we implemented in the previous section (alcohol concentration and OD280/OD315 of diluted wines). However, as far as interpretability is concerned, the random forest technique comes with an import- ant gotcha that is worth mentioning. If two or more features are highly correlated, one feature may be ranked very highly while the information on the other feature(s) may not be fully captured. On the other hand, we don\u2019t need to be concerned about this problem if we are merely interested in the predictive performance of a model rather than the interpretation of feature importance values. To conclude this section about feature importance values and random forests, it is worth mentioning that scikit-learn also implements a SelectFromModel object that selects features based on a user-spec- ified threshold after model fitting, which is useful if we want to use the RandomForestClassifier as a feature selector and intermediate step in a scikit-learn Pipeline object, which allows us to connect different preprocessing steps with an estimator, as you will see in Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning. For example, we could set the threshold to 0.1 to reduce the dataset to the five most important features using the following code: >>> from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel >>> sfm = SelectFromModel(forest, threshold=0.1, prefit=True) >>> X_selected = sfm.transform(X_train) >>> print('Number of features that meet this threshold', ...

Before we feed data to a machine learning algorithm, we also have to make sure that we encode categorical variables correctly, and in this chapter, we saw how we can map ordinal and nom- inal feature values to integer representations. Moreover, we briefly discussed L1 regularization, which can help us to avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity of a model. As an alternative approach to removing irrelevant features, we used a sequential feature selection algorithm to select meaningful features from a dataset. In the next chapter, you will learn about yet another useful approach to dimensionality reduction: feature extraction. It allows us to compress features onto a lower-dimensional subspace, rather than removing features entirely as in feature selection.

In this chap- ter, you will learn about two fundamental techniques that will help you to summarize the information content of a dataset by transforming it onto a new feature subspace of lower dimensionality than the original one. Data compression is an important topic in machine learning, and it helps us to store and analyze the increasing amounts of data that are produced and collected in the modern age of technology.

The difference between feature selection and feature extraction is that while we maintain the original features when we use feature selection algorithms, such as sequential back- ward selection, we use feature extraction to transform or project the data onto a new feature space. In the context of dimensionality reduction, feature extraction can be understood as an approach to data compression with the goal of maintaining most of the relevant information.

Other popular applications of PCA include exploratory data analysis and the denoising of signals in stock market trading, and the analysis of genome data and gene expression levels in the field of bioinformatics. PCA helps us to identify patterns in data based on the correlation between features. In a nutshell, PCA aims to find the directions of maximum variance in high-dimensional data and projects the data onto a new subspace with equal or fewer dimensions than the original one. The orthogonal axes (principal components) of the new subspace can be interpreted as the directions of maximum variance given the constraint that the new feature axes are orthogonal to each other, as illustrated in Figure 5.1: Figure 5.1: Using PCA to find the directions of maximum variance in a dataset In Figure 5.1, x1 and x2 are the original feature axes, and PC 1 and PC 2 are the principal components. If we use PCA for dimensionality reduction, we construct a d\u00d7k-dimensional transformation matrix, W, that allows us to map a vector of the features of the training example, x, onto a new k-dimensional feature subspace that has fewer dimensions than the original d-dimensional feature space. For instance, the process is as follows. Suppose we have a feature vector, x: \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99[\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652, \u2026 , \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51], \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 which is then transformed by a transformation matrix, \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51: xW = z resulting in the output vector: \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b[\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc671, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc672, \u2026 , \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58], \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 169, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

All consequent principal components will have the largest variance given the constraint that these components are uncorrelated (orthogonal) to the other principal components\u2014even if the input features are correlated, the resulting principal components will be mutually orthogonal (uncorrelated). Note that the PCA directions are highly sensitive to data scaling, and we need to standardize the features prior to PCA if the features were measured on different scales and we want to assign equal importance to all features. Before looking at the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction in more detail, let\u2019s summarize the approach in a few simple steps: 1. Standardize the d-dimensional dataset. 2. Construct the covariance matrix. 3. Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. 4. Sort the eigenvalues by decreasing order to rank the corresponding eigenvectors. 5. Select k eigenvectors, which correspond to the k largest eigenvalues, where k is the dimension- ality of the new feature subspace (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 ). 6. Construct a projection matrix, W, from the \u201ctop\u201d k eigenvectors. 7. Transform the d-dimensional input dataset, X, using the projection matrix, W, to obtain the new k-dimensional feature subspace. In the following sections, we will perform a PCA step by step using Python as a learning exercise. Then, we will see how to perform a PCA more conveniently using scikit-learn. Eigendecomposition: Decomposing a Matrix into Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues Eigendecomposition, the factorization of a square matrix into so-called eigenvalues and eigenvectors, is at the core of the PCA procedure described in this section. The covariance matrix is a special case of a square matrix: it\u2019s a symmetric matrix, which means that the matrix is equal to its transpose, A = A T. When we decompose such a symmetric matrix, the eigenvalues are real (rather than complex) numbers, and the eigenvectors are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other. Furthermore, eigenvalues and eigenvectors come in pairs. If we decompose a covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues, the eigenvectors associated with the highest eigenvalue corresponds to the direction of maximum variance in the dataset. Here, this \u201cdirection\u201d is a linear transformation of the dataset\u2019s feature columns.

A positive covariance between two features indicates that the features increase or decrease together, whereas a negative covariance indicates that the features vary in opposite directions.

Total and explained variance Since we want to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset by compressing it onto a new feature sub- space, we only select the subset of the eigenvectors (principal components) that contains most of the information (variance).

The variance explained ratio of an eigenvalue, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57, is simply the fraction of an eigenvalue, \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57, and the total sum of the eigenvalues: Explained variance ratio = \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 \u2211 \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 Eigendecomposition in NumPy The numpy.linalg.eig function was designed to operate on both symmetric and non-sym- metric square matrices.

Feature transformation Now that we have successfully decomposed the covariance matrix into eigenpairs, let\u2019s proceed with the last three steps to transform the Wine dataset onto the new principal component axes.

We start by sorting the eigenpairs by decreasing order of the eigenvalues: >>> # Make a list of (eigenvalue, eigenvector) tuples >>> eigen_pairs = [(np.abs(eigen_vals[i]), eigen_vecs[:, i]) ... for i in range(len(eigen_vals))] >>> # Sort the (eigenvalue, eigenvector) tuples from high to low >>> eigen_pairs.sort(key=lambda k: k[0], reverse=True) Next, we collect the two eigenvectors that correspond to the two largest eigenvalues, to capture about 60 percent of the variance in this dataset. Note that two eigenvectors have been chosen for the purpose of illustration, since we are going to plot the data via a two-dimensional scatterplot later in this sub- section. In practice, the number of principal components has to be determined by a tradeoff between computational efficiency and the performance of the classifier: >>> w = np.hstack((eigen_pairs[0][1][:, np.newaxis], ... eigen_pairs[1][1][:, np.newaxis])) >>> print('Matrix W:\\n', w) Matrix W: [[-0.13724218 0.50303478] [ 0.24724326 0.16487119] [-0.02545159 0.24456476] [ 0.20694508 -0.11352904] [-0.15436582 0.28974518]", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 175, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Using the projection matrix, we can now transform an example, x (represented as a 13-dimensional row vector), onto the PCA subspace (the principal components one and two) obtaining x\u2032, now a two-dimensional example vector consisting of two new features: x\u2032 = xW >>> X_train_std[0].dot(w) array([ 2.38299011, 0.45458499]) Similarly, we can transform the entire 124\u00d713-dimensional training dataset onto the two principal components by calculating the matrix dot product: X\u2032 = XW >>> X_train_pca = X_train_std.dot(w) Mirrored projections Depending on which versions of NumPy and LAPACK you are using, you may obtain the matrix, W, with its signs flipped.

Assessing feature contributions In this section, we will take a brief look at how we can assess the contributions of the original features to the principal components. As we learned, via PCA, we create principal components that represent linear combinations of the features. Sometimes, we are interested to know about how much each orig- inal feature contributes to a given principal component. These contributions are often called loadings. The factor loadings can be computed by scaling the eigenvectors by the square root of the eigenvalues. The resulting values can then be interpreted as the correlation between the original features and the principal component. To illustrate this, let us plot the loadings for the first principal component. First, we compute the 13\u00d713-dimensional loadings matrix by multiplying the eigenvectors by the square root of the eigenvalues: >>> loadings = eigen_vecs * np.sqrt(eigen_vals) Then, we plot the loadings for the first principal component, loadings[:, 0], which is the first col- umn in this matrix: >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots() >>> ax.bar(range(13), loadings[:, 0], align='center') >>> ax.set_ylabel('Loadings for PC 1') >>> ax.set_xticks(range(13)) >>> ax.set_xticklabels(df_wine.columns[1:], rotation=90) >>> plt.ylim([-1, 1]) >>> plt.tight_layout() >>> plt.show() In Figure 5.6, we can see that, for example, Alcohol has a negative correlation with the first principal component (approximately \u20130.3), whereas Malic acid has a positive correlation (approximately 0.54). Note that a value of 1 describes a perfect positive correlation whereas a value of \u20131 corresponds to a perfect negative correlation:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 181, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Supervised data compression via linear discriminant analysis LDA can be used as a technique for feature extraction to increase computational efficiency and reduce the degree of overfitting due to the curse of dimensionality in non-regularized models. The general concept behind LDA is very similar to PCA, but whereas PCA attempts to find the orthogonal component axes of maximum variance in a dataset, the goal in LDA is to find the feature subspace that optimizes class separability. In the following sections, we will discuss the similarities between LDA and PCA in more detail and walk through the LDA approach step by step. Principal component analysis versus linear discriminant analysis Both PCA and LDA are linear transformation techniques that can be used to reduce the number of di- mensions in a dataset; the former is an unsupervised algorithm, whereas the latter is supervised. Thus, we might think that LDA is a superior feature extraction technique for classification tasks compared to PCA. However, A.M. Martinez reported that preprocessing via PCA tends to result in better clas- sification results in an image recognition task in certain cases, for instance, if each class consists of only a small number of examples (PCA Versus LDA by A.

Although the exemplary linear discriminant shown on the y axis (LD 2) captures a lot of the variance in the dataset, it would fail as a good linear discriminant since it does not capture any of the class-discriminatory information. One assumption in LDA is that the data is normally distributed. Also, we assume that the classes have identical covariance matrices and that the training examples are statistically independent of each oth- er. However, even if one, or more, of those assumptions is (slightly) violated, LDA for dimensionality reduction can still work reasonably well (Pattern Classification 2nd Edition by R. O. Duda, P. E. Hart, and D. G. Stork, New York, 2001). Fisher LDA LDA is sometimes also called Fisher\u2019s LDA. Ronald A.

In the following sections, we will discuss these seven steps in more detail, accompanied by illustrative code implementations.

One nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly worth highlighting is t-dis- tributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) since it is frequently used in literature to visualize high-dimensional datasets in two or three dimensions. We will see how we can apply t-SNE to plot images of handwritten images in a 2-dimensional feature space. Why consider nonlinear dimensionality reduction?

However, if we are dealing with nonlinear problems, which we may encounter rather frequently in real-world applications, linear transformation techniques for dimensionality reduction, such as PCA and LDA, may not be the best choice: Figure 5.13: The difference between linear and nonlinear problems The scikit-learn library implements a selection of advanced techniques for nonlinear dimensionality reduction that are beyond the scope of this book. The interested reader can find a nice overview of the current implementations in scikit-learn, complemented by illustrative examples, at http://scikit- learn.org/stable/modules/manifold.html. The development and application of nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques is also often referred to as manifold learning, where a manifold refers to a lower dimensional topological space embedded in a high-dimensional space.

The reason behind this difficulty is that we are often working with high-dimensional datasets that we cannot readily visualize and where the structure is not obvious (unlike the Swiss roll example in Figure 5.14). Moreover, unless we project the dataset into two or three dimensions (which is often not sufficient for capturing more complicated relationships), it is hard or even impossible to assess the quality of the results. Hence, many people still rely on simpler techniques such as PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction.

Then, it finds a probability distribution of pair-wise distances in the new, lower-dimensional space that is close to the probability distribution of pair-wise distances in the original space. Or, in other words, t-SNE learns to embed data points into a lower-dimensional space such that the pairwise distances in the original space are preserved. You can find more details about this method in the original research paper Visualizing data using t-SNE by Maaten and Hinton, Jour- nal of Machine Learning Research, 2018 (https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/ vandermaaten08a.pdf). However, as the research paper title suggests, t-SNE is a technique intended for visualization purposes as it requires the whole dataset for the projection. Since it projects the points directly (unlike PCA, it does not involve a projection matrix), we cannot apply t-SNE to new data points. The following code shows a quick demonstration of how t-SNE can be applied to a 64-dimensional dataset. First, we load the Digits dataset from scikit-learn, which consists of low-resolution handwrit- ten digits (the numbers 0-9): >>> from sklearn.datasets import load_digits >>> digits = load_digits() The digits are 8\u00d78 grayscale images.

The resulting plot is as follows: Figure 5.16: A visualization of how t-SNE embeds the handwritten digits in a 2D feature space As we can see, t-SNE is able to separate the different digits (classes) nicely, although not perfectly. It might be possible to achieve better separation by tuning the hyperparameters. However, a certain degree of class mixing might be unavoidable due to illegible handwriting. For instance, by inspecting individual images, we might find that certain instances of the number 3 indeed look like the number 9, and so forth. Uniform manifold approximation and projection Another popular visualization technique is uniform manifold approximation and pro- jection (UMAP). While UMAP can produce similarly good results as t-SNE (for example, see the Kobak and Linderman paper referenced previously), it is typically faster, and it can also be used to project new data, which makes it more attractive as a dimensionality reduction technique in a machine learning context, similar to PCA.

Lastly, you also learned about t-SNE, which is a nonlinear feature extraction technique that can be used for visualizing data in two or three dimensions.

After encoding the class labels (diagnosis) in an array, y, the malignant tumors are now rep- resented as class 1, and the benign tumors are represented as class 0, respectively.

In our preceding code example, we provided two scikit-learn transformers, StandardScaler and PCA, and a LogisticRegression estimator as inputs to the make_pipeline func- tion, which constructs a scikit-learn Pipeline object from these objects. We can think of a scikit-learn Pipeline as a meta-estimator or wrapper around those individual transformers and estimators. If we call the fit method of Pipeline, the data will be passed down a series of transformers via fit and transform calls on these intermediate steps until it arrives at the estimator object (the final element in a pipeline). The estimator will then be fitted to the transformed training data. When we executed the fit method on the pipe_lr pipeline in the preceding code example, StandardScaler first performed fit and transform calls on the training data. Second, the trans- formed training data was passed on to the next object in the pipeline, PCA. Similar to the previous step, PCA also executed fit and transform on the scaled input data and passed it to the final element of the pipeline, the estimator. Finally, the LogisticRegression estimator was fit to the training data after it underwent transfor- mations via StandardScaler and PCA. Again, we should note that there is no limit to the number of intermediate steps in a pipeline; however, if we want to use the pipeline for prediction tasks, the last pipeline element has to be an estimator. Similar to calling fit on a pipeline, pipelines also implement a predict method if the last step in the pipeline is an estimator. If we feed a dataset to the predict call of a Pipeline object instance, the data will pass through the intermediate steps via transform calls. In the final step, the estimator object will then return a prediction on the transformed data.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 203, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The holdout method A classic and popular approach for estimating the generalization performance of machine learning models is the holdout method. Using the holdout method, we split our initial dataset into separate training and test datasets\u2014the former is used for model training, and the latter is used to estimate its generalization performance. However, in typical machine learning applications, we are also inter- ested in tuning and comparing different parameter settings to further improve the performance for making predictions on unseen data. This process is called model selection, with the name referring to a given classification problem for which we want to select the optimal values of tuning parameters (also called hyperparameters). However, if we reuse the same test dataset over and over again during model selection, it will become part of our training data and thus the model will be more likely to overfit. Despite this issue, many people still use the test dataset for model selection, which is not a good machine learning practice.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 204, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The training dataset is used to fit the dif- ferent models, and the performance on the validation dataset is then used for model selection. The advantage of having a test dataset that the model hasn\u2019t seen before during the training and model selection steps is that we can obtain a less biased estimate of its ability to generalize to new data. Figure 6.2 illustrates the concept of holdout cross-validation, where we use a validation dataset to repeatedly evaluate the performance of the model after training using different hyperparameter values. Once we are satisfied with the tuning of hyperparameter values, we estimate the model\u2019s generalization performance on the test dataset: Figure 6.2: How to use training, validation, and test datasets A disadvantage of the holdout method is that the performance estimate may be very sensitive to how we partition the training dataset into the training and validation subsets; the estimate will vary for different examples of the data. In the next subsection, we will take a look at a more robust technique for performance estimation, k-fold cross-validation, where we repeat the holdout method k times on k subsets of the training data. K-fold cross-validation In k-fold cross-validation, we randomly split the training dataset into k folds without replacement. Here, k \u2013 1 folds, the so-called training folds, are used for the model training, and one fold, the so-called test fold, is used for performance evaluation. This procedure is repeated k times so that we obtain k models and performance estimates. Sampling with and without replacement We looked at an example to illustrate sampling with and without replacement in Chapter 3.

Typically, we use k-fold cross-validation for model tuning, that is, finding the optimal hyperparameter values that yield a satisfying generalization performance, which is estimated from evaluating the model performance on the test folds. Once we have found satisfactory hyperparameter values, we can retrain the model on the complete training dataset and obtain a final performance estimate using the independent test dataset. The rationale behind fitting a model to the whole training dataset after k-fold cross-validation is that first, we are typically interested in a single, final model (versus k individual models), and second, providing more training examples to a learning algorithm usually results in a more accurate and robust model. Since k-fold cross-validation is a resampling technique without replacement, the advantage of this approach is that in each iteration, each example will be used exactly once, and the training and test folds are disjoint. Furthermore, all test folds are disjoint; that is, there is no overlap between the test folds. Figure 6.3 summarizes the concept behind k-fold cross-validation with k = 10. The training dataset is divided into 10 folds, and during the 10 iterations, 9 folds are used for training, and 1 fold will be used as the test dataset for model evaluation. Also, the estimated performances, Ei (for example, classification accuracy or error), for each fold are then used to calculate the estimated average performance, E, of the model: Figure 6.3: How k-fold cross-validation works In summary, k-fold cross-validation makes better use of the dataset than the holdout method with a validation set, since in k-fold cross-validation all data points are being used for evaluation. A good standard value for k in k-fold cross-validation is 10, as empirical evidence shows. For instance, experiments by Ron Kohavi on various real-world datasets suggest that 10-fold cross-validation offers the best tradeoff between bias and variance (A Study of Cross-Validation and Bootstrap for Accuracy Esti- mation and Model Selection by Kohavi, Ron, International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), 14 (12): 1137-43, 1995, https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/95-2/Papers/016.pdf).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 206, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

If we increase the value of k, more training data will be used in each iteration, which results in a lower pessimistic bias toward estimating the generalization performance by averaging the individ- ual model estimates. However, large values of k will also increase the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm and yield estimates with higher variance, since the training folds will be more similar to each other. On the other hand, if we are working with large datasets, we can choose a smaller value for k, for example, k = 5, and still obtain an accurate estimate of the average performance of the model while reducing the computational cost of refitting and evaluating the model on the different folds. A slight improvement over the standard k-fold cross-validation approach is stratified k-fold cross-val- idation, which can yield better bias and variance estimates, especially in cases of unequal class pro- portions, which has also been shown in the same study by Ron Kohavi referenced previously in this section. In stratified cross-validation, the class label proportions are preserved in each fold to ensure that each fold is representative of the class proportions in the training dataset, which we will illustrate by using the StratifiedKFold iterator in scikit-learn: >>> import numpy as np >>> from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold >>> kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10).split(X_train, y_train) >>> scores = [] >>> for k, (train, test) in enumerate(kfold): ... pipe_lr.fit(X_train[train], y_train[train]) ... score = pipe_lr.score(X_train[test], y_train[test]) ... scores.append(score) ... print(f'Fold: {k+1:02d}, ' ... f'Class distr.: {np.bincount(y_train[train])}, ' ... f'Acc.: {score:.3f}') Fold: 01, Class distr.: [256 153], Acc.: 0.935 Fold: 02, Class distr.: [256 153], Acc.: 0.935 Fold: 03, Class distr.: [256 153], Acc.: 0.957 Fold: 04, Class distr.: [256 153], Acc.: 0.957 Leave-one-out cross-validation A special case of k-fold cross-validation is the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method.

If we set the n_jobs parameter to 1, only one CPU will be used to evaluate the performances, just like in our StratifiedKFold example previously. However, by setting n_jobs=2, we could distribute the 10 rounds of cross-validation to two CPUs (if available on our machine), and by setting n_jobs=-1, we can use all available CPUs on our machine to do the computation in parallel. Debugging algorithms with learning and validation curves In this section, we will take a look at two very simple yet powerful diagnostic tools that can help us to improve the performance of a learning algorithm: learning curves and validation curves. In the next subsections, we will discuss how we can use learning curves to diagnose whether a learning algorithm has a problem with overfitting (high variance) or underfitting (high bias). Furthermore, we will take a look at validation curves, which can help us to address the common issues of learning algorithms. Diagnosing bias and variance problems with learning curves If a model is too complex for a given training dataset\u2014for example, think of a very deep decision tree\u2014the model tends to overfit the training data and does not generalize well to unseen data. Often, it can help to collect more training examples to reduce the degree of overfitting. However, in practice, it can often be very expensive or simply not feasible to collect more data. By plotting the model training and validation accuracies as functions of the training dataset size, we can easily detect whether the model suffers from high variance or high bias, and whether the collection of more data could help to address this problem. Estimating generalization performance Please note that a detailed discussion of how the variance of the generalization perfor- mance is estimated in cross-validation is beyond the scope of this book, but you can refer to a comprehensive article about model evaluation and cross-validation (Model Evalua- tion, Model Selection, and Algorithm Selection in Machine Learning by S. Raschka), which we share at https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12808. This article also discusses alternative cross-validation techniques, such as the .632 and .632+ bootstrap cross-validation methods.

This model has both low training and cross-validation accuracy, which indicates that it underfits the training data. Common ways to address this issue are to increase the number of model parameters, for example, by collecting or constructing additional features, or by decreasing the degree of regularization, for example, in support vector machine (SVM) or logistic regression classifiers. The graph in the upper-right shows a model that suffers from high variance, which is indicated by the large gap between the training and cross-validation accuracy. To address this problem of overfitting, we can collect more training data, reduce the complexity of the model, or increase the regularization parameter, for example. For unregularized models, it can also help to decrease the number of features via feature selection (Chapter 4) or feature extraction (Chapter 5) to decrease the degree of overfitting. While collecting more training data usually tends to decrease the chance of overfitting, it may not always help, for example, if the training data is extremely noisy or the model is already very close to optimal.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 210, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

After we have successfully executed the preceding code, we will obtain the following learning curve plot: Figure 6.5: A learning curve showing training and validation dataset accuracy by the number of training examples Via the train_sizes parameter in the learning_curve function, we can control the absolute or relative number of training examples that are used to generate the learning curves. Here, we set train_sizes=np.linspace(0.1, 1.0, 10) to use 10 evenly spaced, relative intervals for the training dataset sizes. By default, the learning_curve function uses stratified k-fold cross-validation to cal- culate the cross-validation accuracy of a classifier, and we set k = 10 via the cv parameter for 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Then, we simply calculated the average accuracies from the returned cross-validated training and test scores for the different sizes of the training dataset, which we plotted using Matplotlib\u2019s plot function.

Inside the validation_curve function, we specified the parameter that we wanted to evaluate. In this case, it is C, the inverse regularization parameter of the LogisticRegression classifier, which we wrote as 'logisticregression__C' to ac- cess the LogisticRegression object inside the scikit-learn pipeline for a specified value range that we set via the param_range parameter. Similar to the learning curve example in the previous section, we plotted the average training and cross-validation accuracies and the corresponding standard deviations. Although the differences in the accuracy for varying values of C are subtle, we can see that the model slightly underfits the data when we increase the regularization strength (small values of C). However, for large values of C, it means lowering the strength of regularization, so the model tends to slightly overfit the data. In this case, the sweet spot appears to be between 0.01 and 0.1 of the C value. Fine-tuning machine learning models via grid search In machine learning, we have two types of parameters: those that are learned from the training data, for example, the weights in logistic regression, and the parameters of a learning algorithm that are op- timized separately. The latter are the tuning parameters (or hyperparameters) of a model, for example, the regularization parameter in logistic regression or the maximum depth parameter of a decision tree. In the previous section, we used validation curves to improve the performance of a model by tuning one of its hyperparameters.

We set the param_grid parameter of GridSearchCV to a list of dictionaries to specify the parameters that we\u2019d want to tune. For the linear SVM, we only evaluated the inverse regularization parameter, C; for the radial basis function (RBF) kernel SVM, we tuned both the svc__C and svc__gamma parameters. Note that the svc__gamma parameter is specific to kernel SVMs. GridSearchCV uses k-fold cross-validation for comparing models trained with different hyperparam- eter settings. Via the cv=10 setting, it will carry out 10-fold cross-validation and compute the average accuracy (via scoring='accuracy') across these 10-folds to assess the model performance. We set n_jobs=-1 so that GridSearchCV can use all our processing cores to speed up the grid search by fitting models to the different folds in parallel, but if your machine has problems with this setting, you may change this setting to n_jobs=None for single processing. After we used the training data to perform the grid search, we obtained the score of the best-perform- ing model via the best_score_ attribute and looked at its parameters, which can be accessed via the best_params_ attribute.

The GridSearchCV class has a refit parameter, which will refit the gs.best_estimator_ to the whole training set auto- matically if we set refit=True (default). Exploring hyperparameter configurations more widely with randomized search Since grid search is an exhaustive search, it is guaranteed to find the optimal hyperparameter configu- ration if it is contained in the user-specified parameter grid. However, specifying large hyperparameter grids makes grid search very expensive in practice. An alternative approach for sampling different parameter combinations is randomized search. In randomized search, we draw hyperparameter configurations randomly from distributions (or discrete sets). In contrast to grid search, randomized search does not do an exhaustive search over the hyperparameter space. Still, it allows us to explore a wider range of hyperparameter value settings in a more cost- and time-effective manner. This concept is illustrated in Figure 6.7, which shows a fixed grid of nine hyperparameter settings being searched via grid search and randomized search: Figure 6.7: A comparison of grid search and randomized search for sampling nine different hyper- parameter configurations each The main takeaway is that while grid search only explores discrete, user-specified choices, it may miss good hyperparameter configurations if the search space is too scarce.

Scikit-learn implements a RandomizedSearchCV class, which is analogous to the GridSearchCV we used in the previous subsec- tion. The main difference is that we can specify distributions as part of our parameter grid and specify the total number of hyperparameter configurations to be evaluated. For example, let\u2019s consider the hyperparameter range we used for several hyperparameters when tuning the SVM in the grid search example in the previous section: >>> param_range = [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, ... 1.0, 10.0, 100.0, 1000.0] Note that while RandomizedSearchCV can accept similar discrete lists of values as inputs for the pa- rameter grid, which is useful when considering categorical hyperparameters, its main power lies in the fact that we can replace these lists with distributions to sample from. Thus, for example, we may substitute the preceding list with the following distribution from SciPy: >>> param_range = scipy.stats.loguniform(0.0001, 1000.0) For instance, using a loguniform distribution instead of a regular uniform distribution will ensure that in a sufficiently large number of trials, the same number of samples will be drawn from the [0.0001, 0.001] range as, for example, the [10.0, 100.0] range. To check its behavior, we can draw 10 random samples from this distribution via the rvs(10) method, as shown here: >>> np.random.seed(1) >>> param_range.rvs(10) array([8.30145146e-02, 1.10222804e+01, 1.00184520e-04, 1.30715777e-02, 1.06485687e-03, 4.42965766e-04, 2.01289666e-03, 2.62376594e-02, 5.98924832e-02, 5.91176467e-01]) Let\u2019s now see the RandomizedSearchCV in action and tune an SVM as we did with GridSearchCV in the previous section: >>> from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV >>> pipe_svc = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), ... SVC(random_state=1)) Specifying distributions RandomizedSearchCV supports arbitrary distributions as long as we can sample from them by calling the rvs() method.

More resource-efficient hyperparameter search with successive halving Taking the idea of randomized search one step further, scikit-learn implements a successive halving variant, HalvingRandomSearchCV, that makes finding suitable hyperparameter configurations more efficient. Successive halving, given a large set of candidate configurations, successively throws out unpromising hyperparameter configurations until only one configuration remains. We can summarize the procedure via the following steps: 1. Draw a large set of candidate configurations via random sampling 2. Train the models with limited resources, for example, a small subset of the training data (as opposed to using the entire training set) 3. Discard the bottom 50 percent based on predictive performance 4.

Note that there is also a successive halving implementation for the grid search variant called HalvingGridSearchCV, where all specified hyperparameter configurations are used in step 1 instead of random samples. In scikit-learn 1.0, HalvingRandomSearchCV is still experimental, which is why we have to enable it first: >>> from sklearn.experimental import enable_halving_search_cv (The above code may not work or be supported in future releases.) After enabling the experimental support, we can use randomized search with successive halving as shown in the following: >>> from sklearn.model_selection import HalvingRandomSearchCV >>> hs = HalvingRandomSearchCV(pipe_svc, ... param_distributions=param_grid, ... n_candidates='exhaust', ... resource='n_samples', ... factor=1.5, ... random_state=1, ... n_jobs=-1) The resource='n_samples' (default) setting specifies that we consider the training set size as the re- source we vary between the rounds. Via the factor parameter, we can determine how many candidates are eliminated in each round. For example, setting factor=2 eliminates half of the candidates, and set- ting factor=1.5 means that only 100%/1.5 \u2248 66% of the candidates make it into the next round. Instead of choosing a fixed number of iterations as in RandomizedSearchCV, we set n_candidates='exhaust' (default), which will sample the number of hyperparameter configurations such that the maximum number of resources (here: training examples) are used in the last round. We can then carry out the search similar to RandomizedSearchCV: >>> hs = hs.fit(X_train, y_train) >>> print(hs.best_score_) 0.9617647058823529 >>> print(hs.best_params_) {'svc__C': 4.934834261073341, 'svc__kernel': 'linear'}", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 219, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Algorithm selection with nested cross-validation Using k-fold cross-validation in combination with grid search or randomized search is a useful ap- proach for fine-tuning the performance of a machine learning model by varying its hyperparam- eter values, as we saw in the previous subsections. If we want to select among different machine learning algorithms, though, another recommended approach is nested cross-validation. In a nice study on the bias in error estimation, Sudhir Varma and Richard Simon concluded that the true error of the estimate is almost unbiased relative to the test dataset when nested cross-validation is used (Bias in Error Estimation When Using Cross-Validation for Model Selection by S. Varma and R. Si- mon, BMC Bioinformatics, 7(1): 91, 2006, https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articl es/10.1186/1471-2105-7-91). Hyperparameter tuning with hyperopt Another popular library for hyperparameter optimization is hyperopt (https://github. com/hyperopt/hyperopt), which implements several different methods for hyperpa- rameter optimization, including randomized search and the Tree-structured Parzen Es- timators (TPE) method. TPE is a Bayesian optimization method based on a probabilistic model that is continuously updated based on past hyperparameter evaluations and the associated performance scores instead of regarding these evaluations as independent events.

For example, we can use the nested cross-validation approach to compare an SVM model to a simple decision tree classifier; for simplicity, we will only tune its depth parameter: >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier >>> gs = GridSearchCV( ... estimator=DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=0), ... param_grid=[{'max_depth': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, None]}], ... scoring='accuracy', ... cv=2 ... ) >>> scores = cross_val_score(gs, X_train, y_train, ... scoring='accuracy', cv=5) >>> print(f'CV accuracy: {np.mean(scores):.3f} ' ... f'+/- {np.std(scores):.3f}') CV accuracy: 0.934 +/- 0.016 As we can see, the nested cross-validation performance of the SVM model (97.4 percent) is notably better than the performance of the decision tree (93.4 percent), and thus, we\u2019d expect that it might be the better choice to classify new data that comes from the same population as this particular dataset. Looking at different performance evaluation metrics In the previous sections and chapters, we evaluated different machine learning models using predic- tion accuracy, which is a useful metric with which to quantify the performance of a model in general. However, there are several other performance metrics that can be used to measure a model\u2019s relevance, such as precision, recall, the F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

However, it is also important to decrease the number of benign tumors incorrectly classified as malignant (FP) to not unnecessarily concern patients. In contrast to the FPR, the TPR provides useful information about the fraction of positive (or relevant) examples that were correctly identified out of the total pool of positives (P). The performance metrics precision (PRE) and recall (REC) are related to those TP and TN rates, and in fact, REC is synonymous with TPR: \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45= \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47= \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43= \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39+ \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 In other words, recall quantifies how many of the relevant records (the positives) are captured as such (the true positives). Precision quantifies how many of the records predicted as relevant (the sum of true and false positives) are actually relevant (true positives): \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47+ \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 Revisiting the malignant tumor detection example, optimizing for recall helps with minimizing the chance of not detecting a malignant tumor. However, this comes at the cost of predicting malignant tumors in patients although the patients are healthy (a high number of FPs). If we optimize for preci- sion, on the other hand, we emphasize correctness if we predict that a patient has a malignant tumor. However, this comes at the cost of missing malignant tumors more frequently (a high number of FNs). To balance the up- and downsides of optimizing PRE and REC, the harmonic mean of PRE and REC is used, the so-called F1 score: \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45 Lastly, a measure that summarizes a confusion matrix is the MCC, which is especially popular in biological research contexts.

Chicco and G. Jurman, BMC Genomics. pp. 281-305, 2012, https:// bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-019-6413-7.

A complete list of the different values that are accepted by the scoring parameter can be found at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html. Remember that the positive class in scikit-learn is the class that is labeled as class 1. If we want to specify a different positive label, we can construct our own scorer via the make_scorer function, which we can then directly provide as an argument to the scoring parameter in GridSearchCV (in this ex- ample, using the f1_score as a metric): >>> from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer >>> c_gamma_range = [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0] >>> param_grid = [{'svc__C': c_gamma_range, ...

The diagonal of a ROC graph can be interpreted as random guessing, and classification models that fall below the diagonal are considered as worse than random guessing. A perfect classifier would fall into the top-left corner of the graph with a TPR of 1 and an FPR of 0. Based on the ROC curve, we can then compute the so-called ROC area under the curve (ROC AUC) to characterize the performance of a classification model. Similar to ROC curves, we can compute precision-recall curves for different probability thresholds of a classifier. A function for plotting those precision-recall curves is also implemented in scikit-learn and is documented at http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics. precision_recall_curve.html. Executing the following code example, we will plot a ROC curve of a classifier that only uses two fea- tures from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant. Although we are going to use the same logistic regression pipeline that we defined previously, we are only using two features this time. This is to make the classification task more challenging for the classifier, by withholding useful information contained in the other features, so that the resulting ROC curve becomes visually more interesting. For similar reasons, we are also reducing the number of folds in the StratifiedKFold validator to three. The code is as follows: >>> from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc >>> from numpy import interp >>> pipe_lr = make_pipeline( ... StandardScaler(), ... PCA(n_components=2), ...

Fur- thermore, we interpolated the average ROC curve from the three folds via the interp function that we imported from SciPy and calculated the area under the curve via the auc function. The resulting ROC curve indicates that there is a certain degree of variance between the different folds, and the average ROC AUC (0.76) falls between a perfect score (1.0) and random guessing (0.5): Figure 6.11: The ROC plot Note that if we are just interested in the ROC AUC score, we could also directly import the roc_auc_ score function from the sklearn.metrics submodule, which can be used similarly to the other scoring functions (for example, precision_score) that were introduced in the previous sections. Reporting the performance of a classifier as the ROC AUC can yield further insights into a classifier\u2019s performance with respect to imbalanced samples. However, while the accuracy score can be inter- preted as a single cutoff point on a ROC curve, A. P.

Scoring metrics for multiclass classification The scoring metrics that we\u2019ve discussed so far are specific to binary classification systems. However, scikit-learn also implements macro and micro averaging methods to extend those scoring metrics to multiclass problems via one-vs.-all (OvA) classification.

If we are using binary performance metrics to evaluate multiclass classification models in scikit-learn, a normalized or weighted variant of the macro-average is used by default. The weighted macro-av- erage is calculated by weighting the score of each class label by the number of true instances when calculating the average. The weighted macro-average is useful if we are dealing with class imbalances, that is, different numbers of instances for each label. While the weighted macro-average is the default for multiclass problems in scikit-learn, we can specify the averaging method via the average parameter inside the different scoring functions that we import from the sklearn.metrics module, for example, the precision_score or make_scorer functions: >>> pre_scorer = make_scorer(score_func=precision_score, ... pos_label=1, ... greater_is_better=True, ... average='micro') Dealing with class imbalance We\u2019ve mentioned class imbalances several times throughout this chapter, and yet we haven\u2019t actually discussed how to deal with such scenarios appropriately if they occur. Class imbalance is a quite com- mon problem when working with real-world data\u2014examples from one class or multiple classes are over-represented in a dataset. We can think of several domains where this may occur, such as spam filtering, fraud detection, or screening for diseases. Imagine that the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset that we\u2019ve been working with in this chapter con- sisted of 90 percent healthy patients. In this case, we could achieve 90 percent accuracy on the test dataset by just predicting the majority class (benign tumor) for all examples, without the help of a supervised machine learning algorithm. Thus, training a model on such a dataset that achieves ap- proximately 90 percent test accuracy would mean our model hasn\u2019t learned anything useful from the features provided in this dataset. In this section, we will briefly go over some of the techniques that could help with imbalanced data- sets. But before we discuss different methods to approach this problem, let\u2019s create an imbalanced dataset from our dataset, which originally consisted of 357 benign tumors (class 0) and 212 malignant tumors (class 1): >>> X_imb = np.vstack((X[y == 0], X[y == 1][:40])) >>> y_imb = np.hstack((y[y == 0], y[y == 1][:40]))", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 230, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

If we were to compute the accuracy of a model that always predicts the majority class (benign, class 0), we would achieve a prediction accuracy of approximately 90 percent: >>> y_pred = np.zeros(y_imb.shape[0]) >>> np.mean(y_pred == y_imb) * 100 89.92443324937027 Thus, when we fit classifiers on such datasets, it would make sense to focus on other metrics than accuracy when comparing different models, such as precision, recall, the ROC curve\u2014whatever we care most about in our application. For instance, our priority might be to identify the majority of pa- tients with malignant cancer to recommend an additional screening, so recall should be our metric of choice. In spam filtering, where we don\u2019t want to label emails as spam if the system is not very certain, precision might be a more appropriate metric. Aside from evaluating machine learning models, class imbalance influences a learning algorithm during model fitting itself. Since machine learning algorithms typically optimize a reward or loss function that is computed as a sum over the training examples that it sees during fitting, the decision rule is likely going to be biased toward the majority class. In other words, the algorithm implicitly learns a model that optimizes the predictions based on the most abundant class in the dataset to minimize the loss or maximize the reward during training. One way to deal with imbalanced class proportions during model fitting is to assign a larger penalty to wrong predictions on the minority class. Via scikit-learn, adjusting such a penalty is as convenient as setting the class_weight parameter to class_weight='balanced', which is implemented for most classifiers. Other popular strategies for dealing with class imbalance include upsampling the minority class, downsampling the majority class, and the generation of synthetic training examples. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no universally best solution or technique that works best across different problem domains. Thus, in practice, it is recommended to try out different strategies on a given problem, evaluate the results, and choose the technique that seems most appropriate. The scikit-learn library implements a simple resample function that can help with the upsampling of the minority class by drawing new samples from the dataset with replacement. The following code will take the minority class from our imbalanced Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (here, class 1) and repeatedly draw new samples from it until it contains the same number of examples as class label 0: >>> from sklearn.utils import resample >>> print('Number of class 1 examples before:', ... X_imb[y_imb == 1].shape[0]) Number of class 1 examples before: 40 >>> X_upsampled, y_upsampled = resample( ...

X_upsampled.shape[0]) Number of class 1 examples after: 357 After resampling, we can then stack the original class 0 samples with the upsampled class 1 subset to obtain a balanced dataset as follows: >>> X_bal = np.vstack((X[y == 0], X_upsampled)) >>> y_bal = np.hstack((y[y == 0], y_upsampled)) Consequently, a majority vote prediction rule would only achieve 50 percent accuracy: >>> y_pred = np.zeros(y_bal.shape[0]) >>> np.mean(y_pred == y_bal) * 100 50 Similarly, we could downsample the majority class by removing training examples from the dataset. To perform downsampling using the resample function, we could simply swap the class 1 label with class 0 in the previous code example and vice versa. Summary At the beginning of this chapter, we discussed how to chain different transformation techniques and classifiers in convenient model pipelines that help us to train and evaluate machine learning models more efficiently. We then used those pipelines to perform k-fold cross-validation, one of the essential techniques for model selection and evaluation. Using k-fold cross-validation, we plotted learning and validation curves to diagnose common problems of learning algorithms, such as overfitting and underfitting. Generating new training data to address class imbalance Another technique for dealing with class imbalance is the generation of synthetic training examples, which is beyond the scope of this book. Probably the most widely used algorithm for synthetic training data generation is Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and you can learn more about this technique in the original research article by Nitesh Chawla and others: SMOTE: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 16: 321-357, 2002, which is available at https://www.jair. org/index.php/jair/article/view/10302. It is also highly recommended to check out imbalanced-learn, a Python library that is entirely focused on imbalanced datasets, including an implementation of SMOTE.

In this chapter, we will build upon those techniques and explore different methods for constructing a set of classifiers that can often have a better predictive performance than any of its individual members. We will learn how to do the following: \u2022 Make predictions based on majority voting \u2022 Use bagging to reduce overfitting by drawing random combinations of the training dataset with repetition \u2022 Apply boosting to build powerful models from weak learners that learn from their mistakes Learning with ensembles The goal of ensemble methods is to combine different classifiers into a meta-classifier that has better generalization performance than each individual classifier alone. For example, assuming that we col- lected predictions from 10 experts, ensemble methods would allow us to strategically combine those predictions by the 10 experts to come up with a prediction that was more accurate and robust than the predictions by each individual expert. As you will see later in this chapter, there are several different approaches for creating an ensemble of classifiers. This section will introduce a basic explanation of how ensembles work and why they are typically recognized for yielding a good generalization performance. In this chapter, we will focus on the most popular ensemble methods that use the majority voting principle. Majority voting simply means that we select the class label that has been predicted by the majority of classifiers, that is, received more than 50 percent of the votes. Strictly speaking, the term \u201cmajority vote\u201d refers to binary class settings only. However, it is easy to generalize the majority voting principle to multiclass settings, which is known as plurality voting. (In the UK, people distinguish between majority and plurality voting via the terms \u201cabsolute\u201d and \u201crelative\u201d majority, respectively.)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 234, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Depending on the technique, the ensemble can be built from different classification algorithms, for example, decision trees, support vector machines, logistic regression classifiers, and so on. Alternatively, we can also use the same base classification algorithm, fitting different subsets of the training dataset. One prominent example of this approach is the random forest algorithm combining different decision tree classifiers, which we covered in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn.

For the following example, we will make the assumption that all n-base classifiers for a binary classification task have an equal error rate, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 . Furthermore, we will assume that the classifiers are independent and the error rates are not correlated. Under those assumptions, we can simply express the error probability of an ensemble of base classifiers as a probability mass function of a binomial distribution: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) = \u2211\u27e8\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\u27e9\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58(1 \u2212\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00)\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00ensemble Here, \u27e8\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\u27e9 is the binomial coefficient n choose k. In other words, we compute the probability that the prediction of the ensemble is wrong. Now, let\u2019s take a look at a more concrete example of 11 base classifiers (n = 11), where each classifier has an error rate of 0.25 (\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00\ud835\udf0025): \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) = \u2211\u27e811 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\u27e90.25\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58(1 \u22120.25)11\u2212\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 11 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 = 0.034 As you can see, the error rate of the ensemble (0.034) is much lower than the error rate of each indi- vidual classifier (0.25) if all the assumptions are met. Note that, in this simplified illustration, a 50-50 split by an even number of classifiers, n, is treated as an error, whereas this is only true half of the time.

Let\u2019s assume that we have an ensemble of three base classifiers, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57{1, 2, 3}) , and we want to predict the class label, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99) \u2208{0, 1}, of a given example, x. Two out of three base classifiers predict the class label 0, and one, C3, predicts that the example belongs to class 1. If we weight the predictions of each base classifier equally, the majority vote predicts that the example belongs to class 0: \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc361(\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99) \u21920, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc362(\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99) \u21920, \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc363(\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99) \u21921 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66{0, 0, 1} = 0 Now, let\u2019s assign a weight of 0.6 to C3, and let\u2019s weight C1 and C2 by a coefficient of 0.2: \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2211\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udf12\ud835\udf12\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34(\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99) = \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 = arg max \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 [0.2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc560 + 0.2 \u00d7 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc560, 0.6 \u00d7 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc561] = 1 More simply, since 3\u00d70.2 = 0.6, we can say that the prediction made by C3 has three times more weight than the predictions by C1 or C2, which we can write as follows: \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66{0, 0, 1, 1, 1} = 1 To translate the concept of the weighted majority vote into Python code, we can use NumPy\u2019s con- venient argmax and bincount functions, where bincount counts the number of occurrences of each class label. The argmax function then returns the index position of the highest count, corresponding to the majority class label (this assumes that class labels start at 0): >>> import numpy as np >>> np.argmax(np.bincount([0, 0, 1], ... weights=[0.2, 0.2, 0.6])) 1 As you will remember from the discussion on logistic regression in Chapter 3, certain classifiers in scikit-learn can also return the probability of a predicted class label via the predict_proba method. Using the predicted class probabilities instead of the class labels for majority voting can be useful if the classifiers in our ensemble are well calibrated. The modified version of the majority vote for predicting class labels from probabilities can be written as follows: \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2211\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 239, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Alternatively, we will be able to initialize the ensemble classifier with vote='probability' to predict the class label based on the class membership probabilities.

But first, let\u2019s prepare a dataset that we can test it on. Since we are already familiar with techniques to load datasets from CSV files, we will take a shortcut and load the Iris dataset from scikit-learn\u2019s datasets module. Furthermore, we will only select two features, sepal width and pet- al length, to make the classification task more challenging for illustration purposes. Although our MajorityVoteClassifier generalizes to multiclass problems, we will only classify flower examples from the Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica classes, with which we will compute the ROC AUC later. The code is as follows: >>> from sklearn import datasets >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder >>> iris = datasets.load_iris() >>> X, y = iris.data[50:, [1, 2]], iris.target[50:] >>> le = LabelEncoder() >>> y = le.fit_transform(y) VotingClassifier in scikit-learn Although the MajorityVoteClassifier implementation is very useful for demonstration purposes, we implemented a more sophisticated version of this majority vote classifier in scikit-learn based on the implementation in the first edition of this book. The ensemble classifier is available as sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier in scikit-learn version 0.17 and newer. You can find out more about VotingClassifier at https://scikit- learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier.html Class membership probabilities from decision trees Note that scikit-learn uses the predict_proba method (if applicable) to compute the ROC AUC score. In Chapter 3, we saw how the class probabilities are computed in logistic regression models. In decision trees, the probabilities are calculated from a frequency vector that is created for each node at training time. The vector collects the frequency values of each class label computed from the class label distribution at that node. Then, the frequencies are normalized so that they sum up to 1. Similarly, the class labels of the k-nearest neighbors are aggregated to return the normalized class label frequencies in the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. Although the normalized probabilities returned by both the decision tree and k-nearest neighbors classifier may look similar to the probabilities obtained from a logistic regression model, we have to be aware that they are actually not derived from probability mass functions.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 243, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

To remind ourselves that it is a bad practice to use the test dataset more than once for model evaluation, we are not going to estimate the generalization performance of the tuned hyperparameters in this section. We will move on swiftly to an alternative approach for ensemble learning: bagging. Bagging \u2013 building an ensemble of classifiers from bootstrap samples Bagging is an ensemble learning technique that is closely related to the MajorityVoteClassifier that we implemented in the previous section. However, instead of using the same training dataset to fit the individual classifiers in the ensemble, we draw bootstrap samples (random samples with replacement) from the initial training dataset, which is why bagging is also known as bootstrap aggregating. Building ensembles using stacking The majority vote approach we implemented in this section is not to be confused with stacking. The stacking algorithm can be understood as a two-level ensemble, where the first level consists of individual classifiers that feed their predictions to the second lev- el, where another classifier (typically logistic regression) is fit to the level-one classifier predictions to make the final predictions. For more information on stacking, see the following resources: \u2022 The stacking algorithm has been described in more detail by David H. Wolp- ert in Stacked generalization, Neural Networks, 5(2):241\u2013259, 1992 (https://www. sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608005800231). \u2022 Interested readers can find our video tutorial about stacking on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2emza6g80. \u2022 A scikit-learn compatible version of a stacking classifier is available from mlxtend: http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/user_guide/classifier/ StackingCVClassifier/. \u2022 Also, a StackingClassifier has recently been added to scikit-learn (available in version 0.22 and newer); for more information, please see the documentation at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.

Bagging in a nutshell To provide a more concrete example of how the bootstrap aggregating of a bagging classifier works, let\u2019s consider the example shown in Figure 7.7. Here, we have seven different training instances (de- noted as indices 1-7) that are sampled randomly with replacement in each round of bagging.

We denote these random samples obtained via bagging as Bagging round 1, Bagging round 2, and so on. Each subset contains a certain portion of duplicates and some of the original examples don\u2019t appear in a resampled dataset at all due to sampling with replacement. Once the individual classifiers are fit to the bootstrap samples, the predictions are combined using majority voting. Note that bagging is also related to the random forest classifier that we introduced in Chapter 3. In fact, random forests are a special case of bagging where we also use random feature subsets when fitting the individual decision trees. Applying bagging to classify examples in the Wine dataset To see bagging in action, let\u2019s create a more complex classification problem using the Wine dataset that was introduced in Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets \u2013 Data Preprocessing.

In practice, more complex classifi- cation tasks and a dataset\u2019s high dimensionality can easily lead to overfitting in single decision trees, and this is where the bagging algorithm can really play to its strengths. Finally, we must note that the bagging algorithm can be an effective approach to reducing the variance of a model. However, bagging is ineffective in reducing model bias, that is, models that are too simple to capture the trends in the data well. This is why we want to perform bagging on an ensemble of classifiers with low bias, for example, unpruned decision trees. Leveraging weak learners via adaptive boosting In this last section about ensemble methods, we will discuss boosting, with a special focus on its most common implementation: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost). In boosting, the ensemble consists of very simple base classifiers, also often referred to as weak learners, which often only have a slight performance advantage over random guessing\u2014a typical example of a weak learner is a decision tree stump. The key concept behind boosting is to focus on training examples that are hard to classify, that is, to let the weak learners subsequently learn from misclassified training examples to improve the performance of the ensemble. The following subsections will introduce the algorithmic procedure behind the general concept of boosting and AdaBoost. Lastly, we will use scikit-learn for a practical classification example. How adaptive boosting works In contrast to bagging, the initial formulation of the boosting algorithm uses random subsets of train- ing examples drawn from the training dataset without replacement; the original boosting procedure can be summarized in the following four key steps: 1. Draw a random subset (sample) of training examples, d1, without replacement from the training dataset, D, to train a weak learner, C1. 2. Draw a second random training subset, d2, without replacement from the training dataset and add 50 percent of the examples that were previously misclassified to train a weak learner, C2. AdaBoost recognition The original idea behind AdaBoost was formulated by Robert E. Schapire in 1990 in The Strength of Weak Learnability, Machine Learning, 5(2): 197-227, 1990, URL: http://rob. schapire.net/papers/strengthofweak.pdf. After Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund presented the AdaBoost algorithm in the Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Confer- ence (ICML 1996), AdaBoost became one of the most widely used ensemble methods in the years that followed (Experiments with a New Boosting Algorithm by Y. Freund, R. E. Schapire, and others, ICML, volume 96, 148-156, 1996). In 2003, Freund and Schapire received the G\u00f6del Prize for their groundbreaking work, which is a prestigious prize for the most out- standing publications in the field of computer science.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 258, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Find the training examples, d3, in the training dataset, D, which C1 and C2 disagree upon, to train a third weak learner, C3. 4. Combine the weak learners C1, C2, and C3 via majority voting. As discussed by Leo Breiman (Bias, variance, and arcing classifiers, 1996), boosting can lead to a decrease in bias as well as variance compared to bagging models. In practice, however, boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost are also known for their high variance, that is, the tendency to overfit the training data (An improvement of AdaBoost to avoid overfitting by G. Raetsch, T. Onoda, and K. R. Mueller. Proceedings of the International Conference on Neural Information Processing, CiteSeer, 1998). In contrast to the original boosting procedure described here, AdaBoost uses the complete training dataset to train the weak learners, where the training examples are reweighted in each iteration to build a strong classifier that learns from the mistakes of the previous weak learners in the ensemble. Before we dive deeper into the specific details of the AdaBoost algorithm, let\u2019s take a look at Figure 7.9 to get a better grasp of the basic concept behind AdaBoost: Figure 7.9: The concept of AdaBoost to improve weak learners To walk through the AdaBoost illustration step by step, we will start with subfigure 1, which represents a training dataset for binary classification where all training examples are assigned equal weights. Based on this training dataset, we train a decision stump (shown as a dashed line) that tries to classify the examples of the two classes (triangles and circles), as well as possibly minimizing the loss function (or the impurity score in the special case of decision tree ensembles). For the next round (subfigure 2), we assign a larger weight to the two previously misclassified examples (circles). Furthermore, we lower the weight of the correctly classified examples. The next decision stump will now be more focused on the training examples that have the largest weights\u2014the training examples that are supposedly hard to classify.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 259, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In the case of the 10-sample training dataset, we therefore assign 0.1 to each weight, wi, in the weight vector, w. The predicted class labels, \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\u0302 , are shown in the fifth column, assuming that our splitting criterion is \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65. The last column of the table then shows the updated weights based on the update rules that we defined in the pseudo code. Since the computation of the weight updates may look a little bit complicated at first, we will now follow the calculation step by step. We will start by computing the weighted error rate, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 (epsilon), as described in step 2c: >>> y = np.array([1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1]) >>> yhat = np.array([1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]) >>> correct = (y == yhat) >>> weights = np.full(10, 0.1) >>> print(weights) [0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1] >>> epsilon = np.mean(~correct) >>> print(epsilon) 0.3 Note that correct is a Boolean array consisting of True and False values where True indicates that a prediction is correct. Via ~correct, we invert the array such that np.mean(~correct) computes the proportion of incorrect predictions (True counts as the value 1 and False as 0), that is, the classifica- tion error. Next, we will compute the coefficient, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\u2014shown in step 2d\u2014which will later be used in step 2e to update the weights, as well as for the weights in the majority vote prediction (step 3): >>> alpha_j = 0.5 * np.log((1-epsilon) / epsilon) >>> print(alpha_j) 0.42364893019360184 After we have computed the coefficient, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 (alpha_j), we can now update the weight vector using the following equation: \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\u00d7 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\u0302 \u00d7 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a Here, \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\u0302 \u00d7 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a is an element-wise multiplication between the vectors of the predicted and true class labels, respectively.

Similarly, the weights of the incorrectly classified examples will increase from 0.1 to 0.1667. Applying AdaBoost using scikit-learn The previous subsection introduced AdaBoost in a nutshell.

In practice, we need to think care- fully about whether we want to pay the price of increased computational costs for an often relatively modest improvement in predictive performance. An often-cited example of this tradeoff is the famous $1 million Netflix Prize, which was won using ensemble techniques. The details about the algorithm were published in The BigChaos Solution to the Netflix Grand Prize by A. Toescher, M. Jahrer, and R. M.

Gradient boosting is an extremely important topic because it forms the basis of popular machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, which is well-known for winning Kaggle competitions. The gradient boosting algorithm may appear a bit daunting at first. So, in the following subsections, we will cover it step by step, starting with a general overview. Then, we will see how gradient boosting is used for classification and walk through an example. Finally, after we\u2019ve introduced the fundamental concepts of gradient boosting, we will take a brief look at popular implementations, such as XGBoost, and we will see how we can use gradient boosting in practice. Comparing AdaBoost with gradient boosting Fundamentally, gradient boosting is very similar to AdaBoost, which we discussed previously in this chapter. AdaBoost trains decision tree stumps based on errors of the previous decision tree stump. In particular, the errors are used to compute sample weights in each round as well as for computing a clas- sifier weight for each decision tree stump when combining the individual stumps into an ensemble. We stop training once a maximum number of iterations (decision tree stumps) is reached. Like AdaBoost, gradient boosting fits decision trees in an iterative fashion using prediction errors. However, gradient boosting trees are usually deeper than decision tree stumps and have typically a maximum depth of 3 to 6 (or a maximum number of 8 to 64 leaf nodes). Also, in contrast to AdaBoost, gradient boosting does not use the prediction errors for assigning sample weights; they are used directly to form the target variable for fitting the next tree. Moreover, instead of having an individual weighting term for each tree, like in AdaBoost, gradient boosting uses a global learning rate that is the same for each tree. As you can see, AdaBoost and gradient boosting share several similarities but differ in certain key as- pects. In the following subsection, we will sketch the general outline of the gradient boosting algorithm. Outlining the general gradient boosting algorithm In this section, we will look at gradient boosting for classification. For simplicity, we will look at a binary classification example. Interested readers can find the generalization to the multi-class setting with logistic loss in Section 4.6.

In each round, the tree ensemble improves as we are nudging each tree more in the right direction via small updates. These updates are based on a loss gradient, which is how gradient boosting got its name. The following steps will introduce the general algorithm behind gradient boosting. After illustrating the main steps, we will dive into some of its parts in more detail and walk through a hands-on example in the next subsections. 1. Initialize a model to return a constant prediction value. For this, we use a decision tree root node; that is, a decision tree with a single leaf node. We denote the value returned by the tree as \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 , and we find this value by minimizing a differentiable loss function L that we will define later: \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc390(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65) = arg min \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\u0302 \u2211\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Here, n refers to the n training examples in our dataset. 2. For each tree m = 1, ..., M, where M is a user-specified total number of trees, we carry out the following computations outlined in steps 2a to 2d below: a. Compute the difference between a predicted value \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 and the class label yi. This value is sometimes called the pseudo-response or pseudo-residual. More formally, we can write this pseudo-residual as the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the predicted values: \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \u2212[\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)) \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) ] \ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65)=\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65) for \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Note that in the notation above F(x) is the prediction of the previous tree, Fm\u20131(x).

Jm leaf nodes of the resulting tree in iteration m. Gradient boosting for regression Note that the procedure behind gradient boosting is a bit more complicated than AdaBoost.

In other words, we update the model incrementally by taking small steps, which helps avoid overfitting. Now, after looking at the general structure of gradient boosting, we will adopt these mechanics to look at gradient boosting for classification. Explaining the gradient boosting algorithm for classification In this subsection, we will go over the details for implementing the gradient boosting algorithm for binary classification. In this context, we will be using the logistic loss function that we introduced for logistic regression in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn. For a single training example, we can specify the logistic loss as follows: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56log \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56+ (1 \u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) log(1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) In Chapter 3, we also introduced the log(odds): \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(odds) = log ( \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d 1 \u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) For reasons that will make sense later, we will use these log(odds) to rewrite the logistic function as follows (omitting intermediate steps here): \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= log(1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\u0302\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Now, we can define the partial derivative of the loss function with respect to these log(odds), \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 . The derivative of this loss function with respect to the log(odds) is: \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\u0302\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\u0302\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 268, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For each tree m = 1, ..., M, where M is a user-specified number of total trees, we carry out the following computations outlined in steps 2a to 2d: a.

Illustrating gradient boosting for classification The previous two subsections went over the condensed mathematical details of the gradient boosting algorithm for binary classification. To make these concepts clearer, let\u2019s apply it to a small toy example, that is, a training dataset of the following three examples shown in Figure 7.12: Figure 7.12: Toy dataset for explaining gradient boosting Let\u2019s start with step 1, constructing the root node and computing the log(odds), and step 2a, converting the log(odds) into class-membership probabilities and computing the pseudo-residuals. Note that based on what we have learned in Chapter 3, the odds can be computed as the number of successes divided by the number of failures. Here, we regard label 1 as success and label 0 as failure, so the odds are computed as: odds = 2/1. Carrying out steps 1 and 2a, we get the following results shown in Figure 7.13: Figure 7.13: Results from the first round of applying step 1 and step 2a Outputting log(odds) vs probabilities Why do the trees return log(odds) values and not probabilities?

The new values we obtain in the second round are shown in Figure 7.16: Figure 7.16: Values from the second round next to the values from the first round We can already see that the predicted probabilities are higher for the positive class and lower for the negative class. Consequently, the residuals are getting smaller, too. Note that the process of steps 2a to 2d is repeated until we have fit M trees or the residuals are smaller than a user-specified threshold value. Then, once the gradient boosting algorithm has completed, we can use it to predict the class labels by thresholding the probability values of the final model, FM(x) at 0.5, like logistic regression in Chapter 3. However, in contrast to logistic regression, gradient boosting consists of multiple trees and produces nonlinear decision boundaries. In the next section, we will look at how gradient boosting looks in action. Using XGBoost After covering the nitty-gritty details behind gradient boosting, let\u2019s finally look at how we can use gradient boosting code implementations. In scikit-learn, gradient boosting is implemented as sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier (see https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble. GradientBoostingClassifier.html for more details). It is important to note that gradient boosting is a sequential process that can be slow to train. However, in recent years a more popular implemen- tation of gradient boosting has emerged, namely, XGBoost. XGBoost proposed several tricks and approximations that speed up the training process substantially. Hence, the name XGBoost, which stands for extreme gradient boosting. Moreover, these approxima- tions and tricks result in very good predictive performances. In fact, XGBoost gained popularity as it has been the winning solution for many Kaggle competitions. Next to XGBoost, there are also other popular implementations of gradient boosting, for ex- ample, LightGBM and CatBoost. Inspired by LightGBM, scikit-learn now also implements a HistGradientBoostingClassifier, which is more performant than the original gradient boosting classifier (GradientBoostingClassifier).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 272, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

First, we need to install it, for example via pip: pip install xgboost Fortunately, XGBoost\u2019s XGBClassifier follows the scikit-learn API. So, using it is relatively straight- forward: >>> import xgboost as xgb >>> model = xgb.XGBClassifier(n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.01, ... max_depth=4, random_state=1, ... use_label_encoder=False) >>> gbm = model.fit(X_train, y_train) >>> y_train_pred = gbm.predict(X_train) >>> y_test_pred = gbm.predict(X_test) >>> gbm_train = accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred) >>> gbm_test = accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred) >>> print(f'XGboost train/test accuracies ' ... f'{gbm_train:.3f}/{gbm_test:.3f}') XGboost train/test accuracies 0.968/0.917 Here, we fit the gradient boosting classifier with 1,000 trees (rounds) and a learning rate of 0.01. Typi- cally, a learning rate between 0.01 and 0.1 is recommended. However, remember that the learning rate is used for scaling the predictions from the individual rounds. So, intuitively, the lower the learning rate, the more estimators are required to achieve accurate predictions. Installing XGBoost For this chapter, we used XGBoost version 1.5.0, which can be installed via: pip install XGBoost==1.5.0 You can find more information about the installation details at https://xgboost. readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 273, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Since we are still boosting weak learners, a value between 2 and 6 is reasonable, but larger values may also work well depending on the dataset. Finally, use_label_encoder=False disables a warning message which informs users that XGBoost is not converting labels by default anymore, and it expects users to provide labels in an integer format starting with label 0. (There is nothing to worry about here, since we have been following this format throughout this book.) There are many more settings available, and a detailed discussion is out of the scope of this book. However, interested readers can find more details in the original documentation at https://xgboost. readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html#xgboost.XGBClassifier. Summary In this chapter, we looked at some of the most popular and widely used techniques for ensemble learning. Ensemble methods combine different classification models to cancel out their individual weaknesses, which often results in stable and well-performing models that are very attractive for industrial applications as well as machine learning competitions. At the beginning of this chapter, we implemented MajorityVoteClassifier in Python, which allows us to combine different algorithms for classification. We then looked at bagging, a useful technique for reducing the variance of a model by drawing random bootstrap samples from the training dataset and combining the individually trained classifiers via majority vote. Lastly, we learned about boosting in the form of AdaBoost and gradient boosting, which are algorithms based on training weak learners that subsequently learn from mistakes. Throughout the previous chapters, we learned a lot about different learning algorithms, tuning, and evaluation techniques. In the next chapter, we will look at a particular application of machine learn- ing, sentiment analysis, which has become an interesting topic in the internet and social media era.

Obtaining the movie review dataset A compressed archive of the movie review dataset (84.1 MB) can be downloaded from http:// ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/ as a gzip-compressed tarball archive: \u2022 If you are working with Linux or macOS, you can open a new terminal window, cd into the download directory, and execute tar -zxf aclImdb_v1.tar.gz to decompress the dataset. \u2022 If you are working with Windows, you can download a free archiver, such as 7-Zip (http:// www.7-zip.org), to extract the files from the download archive. \u2022 Alternatively, you can unpack the gzip-compressed tarball archive directly in Python as follows: >>> import tarfile >>> with tarfile.open('aclImdb_v1.tar.gz', 'r:gz') as tar: ... tar.extractall() Preprocessing the movie dataset into a more convenient format Having successfully extracted the dataset, we will now assemble the individual text documents from the decompressed download archive into a single CSV file. In the following code section, we will be reading the movie reviews into a pandas DataFrame object, which can take up to 10 minutes on a standard desktop computer. To visualize the progress and estimated time until completion, we will use the Python Progress Indica- tor (PyPrind, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPrind/) package, which was developed several years ago for such purposes. PyPrind can be installed by executing the pip install pyprind command: >>> import pyprind >>> import pandas as pd >>> import os >>> import sys >>> # change the 'basepath' to the directory of the >>> # unzipped movie dataset >>> basepath = 'aclImdb'", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 277, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Using the nested for loops, we iterated over the train and test subdirectories in the main aclImdb directory and read the individual text files from the pos and neg subdirectories that we eventually appended to the df pandas DataFrame, together with an integer class label (1 = positive and 0 = negative).

In this section, we will introduce the bag-of-words model, which allows us to represent text as numerical feature vectors. The idea behind bag-of-words is quite simple and can be summarized as follows: 1. We create a vocabulary of unique tokens\u2014for example, words\u2014from the entire set of documents. 2. We construct a feature vector from each document that contains the counts of how often each word occurs in the particular document. Since the unique words in each document represent only a small subset of all the words in the bag-of- words vocabulary, the feature vectors will mostly consist of zeros, which is why we call them sparse. Do not worry if this sounds too abstract; in the following subsections, we will walk through the process of creating a simple bag-of-words model step by step. Transforming words into feature vectors To construct a bag-of-words model based on the word counts in the respective documents, we can use the CountVectorizer class implemented in scikit-learn. As you will see in the following code section, CountVectorizer takes an array of text data, which can be documents or sentences, and constructs the bag-of-words model for us: >>> import numpy as np >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer >>> count = CountVectorizer() >>> docs = np.array(['The sun is shining',", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 279, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

'The sun is shining, the weather is sweet,' ... 'and one and one is two']) >>> bag = count.fit_transform(docs) By calling the fit_transform method on CountVectorizer, we constructed the vocabulary of the bag-of-words model and transformed the following three sentences into sparse feature vectors: \u2022 'The sun is shining' \u2022 'The weather is sweet' \u2022 'The sun is shining, the weather is sweet, and one and one is two' Now, let\u2019s print the contents of the vocabulary to get a better understanding of the underlying concepts: >>> print(count.vocabulary_) {'and': 0, 'two': 7, 'shining': 3, 'one': 2, 'sun': 4, 'weather': 8, 'the': 6, 'sweet': 5, 'is': 1} As you can see from executing the preceding command, the vocabulary is stored in a Python dictionary that maps the unique words to integer indices. Next, let\u2019s print the feature vectors that we just created: >>> print(bag.toarray()) [[0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0] [0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1] [2 3 2 1 1 1 2 1 1]] Each index position in the feature vectors shown here corresponds to the integer values that are stored as dictionary items in the CountVectorizer vocabulary. For example, the first feature at index position 0 resembles the count of the word 'and', which only occurs in the last document, and the word 'is', at index position 1 (the second feature in the document vectors), occurs in all three sentences. These values in the feature vectors are also called the raw term frequencies: tf(t, d)\u2014the number of times a term, t, occurs in a document, d. It should be noted that, in the bag-of-words model, the word or term order in a sentence or document does not matter. The order in which the term frequencies appear in the feature vector is derived from the vocabulary indices, which are usually assigned alphabetically.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 280, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

These frequently occurring words typically don\u2019t contain useful or discriminatory information. In this subsection, you will learn about a useful technique called the term frequency-in- verse document frequency (tf-idf), which can be used to downweight these frequently occurring words in the feature vectors. The tf-idf can be defined as the product of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency: tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) \u00d7 idf(t, d) Here, tf(t, d) is the term frequency that we introduced in the previous section, and idf(t, d) is the inverse document frequency, which can be calculated as follows: \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = log \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 1 + \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51) Here, nd is the total number of documents, and df(d, t) is the number of documents, d, that contain the term t. Note that adding the constant 1 to the denominator is optional and serves the purpose of assigning a non-zero value to terms that occur in none of the training examples; the log is used to ensure that low document frequencies are not given too much weight. N-gram models The sequence of items in the bag-of-words model that we just created is also called the 1-gram or unigram model\u2014each item or token in the vocabulary represents a single word. More generally, the contiguous sequences of items in NLP\u2014words, letters, or symbols\u2014are also called n-grams. The choice of the number, n, in the n-gram model depends on the particular application; for example, a study by Ioannis Kanaris and others revealed that n-grams of size 3 and 4 yield good performances in the anti-spam filtering of email mes- sages (Words versus character n-grams for anti-spam filtering by Ioannis Kanaris, Konstantinos Kanaris, Ioannis Houvardas, and Efstathios Stamatatos, International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools, World Scientific Publishing Company, 16(06): 1047-1067, 2007). To summarize the concept of the n-gram representation, the 1-gram and 2-gram repre- sentations of our first document, \u201cthe sun is shining\u201d, would be constructed as follows: \u2022 1-gram: \u201cthe\u201d, \u201csun\u201d, \u201cis\u201d, \u201cshining\u201d \u2022 2-gram: \u201cthe sun\u201d, \u201csun is\u201d, \u201cis shining\u201d The CountVectorizer class in scikit-learn allows us to use different n-gram models via its ngram_range parameter. While a 1-gram representation is used by default, we could switch to a 2-gram representation by initializing a new CountVectorizer instance with ngram_range=(2,2).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 281, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, after transforming the same feature vector into tf-idfs, the word 'is' is now associated with a relatively small tf-idf (0.45) in the third document, since it is also present in the first and second document and thus is unlikely to contain any useful discriminatory information. However, if we\u2019d manually calculated the tf-idfs of the individual terms in our feature vectors, we would have noticed that TfidfTransformer calculates the tf-idfs slightly differently compared to the standard textbook equations that we defined previously. The equation for the inverse document frequency implemented in scikit-learn is computed as follows: \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = log 1 + \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 1 + \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51) Similarly, the tf-idf computed in scikit-learn deviates slightly from the default equation we defined earlier: tf-idf(t, d) = tf(t, d) \u00d7 (idf(t, d) + 1) Note that the \u201c+1\u201d in the previous idf equation is due to setting smooth_idf=True in the previous code example, which is helpful for assigning zero weight (that is, idf(t, d) = log(1) = 0) to terms that occur in all documents. While it is also more typical to normalize the raw term frequencies before calculating the tf-idfs, the TfidfTransformer class normalizes the tf-idfs directly. By default (norm='l2'), scikit-learn\u2019s TfidfTransformer applies the L2-normalization, which returns a vector of length 1 by dividing an unnormalized feature vector, v, by its L2-norm: \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b= \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 \u2016\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\u20162 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 \u221a\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc631 2 + \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc632 2 + \u22ef+ \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b2 = \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 (\u2211 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 2 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 )1/2", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 282, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The word 'is' has a term frequency of 3 (tf = 3) in the third document, and the document frequency of this term is 3 since the term 'is' occurs in all three documents (df = 3). Thus, we can calculate the inverse document frequency as follows: \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56(\"is\", \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc513) = log 1 + 3 1 + 3 = 0 Now, in order to calculate the tf-idf, we simply need to add 1 to the inverse document frequency and multiply it by the term frequency: \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61-\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56(\"is\", \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc513) = 3 \u00d7 (0 + 1) = 3 If we repeated this calculation for all terms in the third document, we\u2019d obtain the following tf-idf vectors: [3.39, 3.0, 3.39, 1.29, 1.29, 1.29, 2.0, 1.69, 1.29]. However, notice that the values in this feature vector are different from the values that we obtained from TfidfTransformer that we used previously.

Cleaning text data In the previous subsections, we learned about the bag-of-words model, term frequencies, and tf-idfs. However, the first important step\u2014before we build our bag-of-words model\u2014is to clean the text data by stripping it of all unwanted characters. To illustrate why this is important, let\u2019s display the last 50 characters from the first document in the reshuffled movie review dataset: >>> df.loc[0, 'review'][-50:] 'is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available' As you can see here, the text contains HTML markup as well as punctuation and other non-letter characters. While HTML markup does not contain many useful semantics, punctuation marks can represent useful, additional information in certain NLP contexts. However, for simplicity, we will now remove all punctuation marks except for emoticon characters, such as :), since those are certainly useful for sentiment analysis.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 283, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

' '.join(emoticons).replace('-', '')) ... return text Via the first regex, <[^>]*>, in the preceding code section, we tried to remove all of the HTML markup from the movie reviews. Although many programmers generally advise against the use of regex to parse HTML, this regex should be sufficient to clean this particular dataset. Since we are only interested in removing HTML markup and do not plan to use the HTML markup further, using regex to do the job should be acceptable. However, if you prefer to use sophisticated tools for removing HTML markup from text, you can take a look at Python\u2019s HTML parser module, which is described at https://docs. python.org/3/library/html.parser.html. After we removed the HTML markup, we used a slightly more complex regex to find emoticons, which we temporarily stored as emoticons. Next, we removed all non-word characters from the text via the regex [\\W]+ and converted the text into lowercase characters. Eventually, we added the temporarily stored emoticons to the end of the processed document string. Additionally, we removed the nose character (- in :-)) from the emoticons for consistency. Dealing with word capitalization In the context of this analysis, we assume that the capitalization of a word\u2014for example, whether it appears at the beginning of a sentence\u2014does not contain semantically relevant information. However, note that there are exceptions; for instance, we remove the notation of proper names. But again, in the context of this analysis, it is a simplifying assumption that the letter case does not contain information that is relevant for sentiment analysis. Regular expressions Although regular expressions offer an efficient and convenient approach to searching for characters in a string, they also come with a steep learning curve. Unfortunately, an in- depth discussion of regular expressions is beyond the scope of this book. However, you can find a great tutorial on the Google Developers portal at https://developers.google. com/edu/python/regular-expressions or you can check out the official documentation of Python\u2019s re module at https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/re.html.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 284, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

But before we talk more about the splitting of documents into individual terms, words, or tokens, let\u2019s confirm that our preprocessor function works correctly: >>> preprocessor(df.loc[0, 'review'][-50:]) 'is seven title brazil not available' >>> preprocessor(\"</a>This :) is :( a test :-)!\") 'this is a test :) :( :)' Lastly, since we will make use of the cleaned text data over and over again during the next sections, let\u2019s now apply our preprocessor function to all the movie reviews in our DataFrame: >>> df['review'] = df['review'].apply(preprocessor) Processing documents into tokens After successfully preparing the movie review dataset, we now need to think about how to split the text corpora into individual elements. One way to tokenize documents is to split them into individual words by splitting the cleaned documents at their whitespace characters: >>> def tokenizer(text): ... return text.split() >>> tokenizer('runners like running and thus they run') ['runners', 'like', 'running', 'and', 'thus', 'they', 'run'] In the context of tokenization, another useful technique is word stemming, which is the process of transforming a word into its root form. It allows us to map related words to the same stem. The origi- nal stemming algorithm was developed by Martin F. Porter in 1979 and is hence known as the Porter stemmer algorithm (An algorithm for suffix stripping by Martin F. Porter, Program: Electronic Library and Information Systems, 14(3): 130\u2013137, 1980).

Before we jump into the next section, where we will train a machine learning model using the bag- of-words model, let\u2019s briefly talk about another useful topic called stop word removal. Stop words are simply those words that are extremely common in all sorts of texts and probably bear no (or only a little) useful information that can be used to distinguish between different classes of documents. Examples of stop words are is, and, has, and like. Removing stop words can be useful if we are working with raw or normalized term frequencies rather than tf-idfs, which already downweight the frequently occurring words. To remove stop words from the movie reviews, we will use the set of 127 English stop words that is available from the NLTK library, which can be obtained by calling the nltk.download function: >>> import nltk >>> nltk.download('stopwords') Stemming algorithms The Porter stemming algorithm is probably the oldest and simplest stemming algorithm. Other popular stemming algorithms include the newer Snowball stemmer (Porter2 or English stemmer) and the Lancaster stemmer (Paice/Husk stemmer). While both the Snowball and Lancaster stemmers are faster than the original Porter stemmer, the Lan- caster stemmer is also notorious for being more aggressive than the Porter stemmer, which means that it will produce shorter and more obscure words. These alternative stemming algorithms are also available through the NLTK package (http://www.nltk.org/api/ nltk.stem.html). While stemming can create non-real words, such as 'thu' (from 'thus'), as shown in the previous example, a technique called lemmatization aims to obtain the canonical (grammatically correct) forms of individual words\u2014the so-called lemmas. However, lem- matization is computationally more difficult and expensive compared to stemming and, in practice, it has been observed that stemming and lemmatization have little impact on the performance of text classification (Influence of Word Normalization on Text Classification, by Michal Toman, Roman Tesar, and Karel Jezek, Proceedings of InSciT, pages 354\u2013358, 2006).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 286, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

First, we will divide the DataFrame of cleaned text documents into 25,000 documents for training and 25,000 documents for testing: >>> X_train = df.loc[:25000, 'review'].values >>> y_train = df.loc[:25000, 'sentiment'].values >>> X_test = df.loc[25000:, 'review'].values >>> y_test = df.loc[25000:, 'sentiment'].values Next, we will use a GridSearchCV object to find the optimal set of parameters for our logistic regression model using 5-fold stratified cross-validation: >>> from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV >>> from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer >>> tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(strip_accents=None, ... lowercase=False, ... preprocessor=None) >>> small_param_grid = [ ... { ...

When we initialized the GridSearchCV object and its parameter grid using the preceding code, we restricted ourselves to a limited number of parameter combinations, since the number of feature vectors, as well as the large vocabulary, can make the grid search computationally quite expensive. Using a standard desktop computer, our grid search may take 5-10 minutes to complete. In the previous code example, we replaced CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer from the previous subsection with TfidfVectorizer, which combines CountVectorizer with the TfidfTransformer. Our param_grid consisted of two parameter dictionaries. In the first dictionary, we used TfidfVectorizer with its default settings (use_idf=True, smooth_idf=True, and norm='l2') to calculate the tf-idfs; in the second dictionary, we set those parameters to use_idf=False, smooth_idf=False, and norm=None in order to train a model based on raw term frequencies. Furthermore, for the logistic regression classifier itself, we trained models using L2 regularization via the penalty parameter and compared different regularization strengths by defining a range of values for the inverse-regularization parameter C. As an optional exercise, you are also encouraged to add L1 regularization to the parameter grid by changing 'clf__penalty': ['l2'] to 'clf__penalty': ['l2', 'l1']. Multiprocessing via the n_jobs parameter Please note that we highly recommend setting n_jobs=-1 (instead of n_jobs=1, as in the previous code example) to utilize all available cores on your machine and speed up the grid search. However, some Windows users reported issues when running the previous code with the n_jobs=-1 setting related to pickling the tokenizer and tokenizer_porter functions for multiprocessing on Windows. Another workaround would be to replace those two functions, [tokenizer, tokenizer_porter], with [str.split]. However, note that replacement by the simple str.split would not support stemming.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 288, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Working with bigger data \u2013 online algorithms and out- of-core learning If you executed the code examples in the previous section, you may have noticed that it could be computationally quite expensive to construct the feature vectors for the 50,000-movie review dataset during a grid search. In many real-world applications, it is not uncommon to work with even larger datasets that can exceed our computer\u2019s memory. The na\u00efve Bayes classifier A still very popular classifier for text classification is the na\u00efve Bayes classifier, which gained popularity in applications of email spam filtering. Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers are easy to implement, computationally efficient, and tend to perform particularly well on rela- tively small datasets compared to other algorithms.

In this section, we will make use of the partial_fit function of SGDClassifier in scikit-learn to stream the documents directly from our local drive and train a logistic regression model using small mini-batches of documents. First, we will define a tokenizer function that cleans the unprocessed text data from the movie_data. csv file that we constructed at the beginning of this chapter and separates it into word tokens while removing stop words: >>> import numpy as np >>> import re >>> from nltk.corpus import stopwords >>> stop = stopwords.words('english') >>> def tokenizer(text): ... text = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', text) ... emoticons = re.findall('(?::|;|=)(?:-)?(?:\\)|\\(|D|P)', ... text.lower()) ... text = re.sub('[\\W]+', ' ', text.lower()) \\ ... + ' '.join(emoticons).replace('-', '') ... tokenized = [w for w in text.split() if w not in stop] ... return tokenized Next, we will define a generator function, stream_docs, that reads in and returns one document at a time: >>> def stream_docs(path): ... with open(path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as csv: ... next(csv) # skip header ... for line in csv: ... text, label = line[:-3], int(line[-2]) ... yield text, label Text classification with recurrent neural networks In Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks, we will revisit this dataset and train a deep learning-based classifier (a recurrent neural network) to classify the reviews in the IMDb movie review dataset.

Also, TfidfVectorizer needs to keep all the feature vectors of the training dataset in memory to calculate the inverse document frequencies.

HashingVectorizer is data-independent and makes use of the hashing trick via the 32-bit MurmurHash3 function by Austin Appleby (you can find more information about MurmurHash at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ MurmurHash): >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer >>> from sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier >>> vect = HashingVectorizer(decode_error='ignore', ... n_features=2**21, ... preprocessor=None, ... tokenizer=tokenizer) >>> clf = SGDClassifier(loss='log', random_state=1) >>> doc_stream = stream_docs(path='movie_data.csv') Using the preceding code, we initialized HashingVectorizer with our tokenizer function and set the number of features to 2**21. Furthermore, we reinitialized a logistic regression classifier by setting the loss parameter of SGDClassifier to 'log'.

For example, a typical application is the categorization of documents in a large text corpus of newspaper articles. In applications of topic modeling, we then aim to assign category labels to those articles, for example, sports, finance, world news, politics, and local news. Thus, in the context of the broad categories of machine learning that we discussed in Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data, we can consider topic modeling as a clustering task, a subcategory of unsupervised learning. In this section, we will discuss a popular technique for topic modeling called latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). However, note that while latent Dirichlet allocation is often abbreviated as LDA, it is not to be confused with linear discriminant analysis, a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that was introduced in Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. Decomposing text documents with LDA Since the mathematics behind LDA is quite involved and requires knowledge of Bayesian inference, we will approach this topic from a practitioner\u2019s perspective and interpret LDA using layman\u2019s terms. However, the interested reader can read more about LDA in the following research paper: Latent Dirichlet Allocation, by David M. Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, and Michael I. Jordan, Journal of Machine Learning Research 3, pages: 993-1022, Jan 2003, https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf. LDA is a generative probabilistic model that tries to find groups of words that appear frequently to- gether across different documents. These frequently appearing words represent our topics, assuming that each document is a mixture of different words. The input to an LDA is the bag-of-words model that we discussed earlier in this chapter. The word2vec model A more modern alternative to the bag-of-words model is word2vec, an algorithm that Google released in 2013 (Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space by T. Mikolov, K. Chen, G. Corrado, and J. Dean, https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781). The word2vec algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm based on neural networks that attempts to automatically learn the relationship between words. The idea behind word2vec is to put words that have similar meanings into similar clusters, and via clever vector spacing, the model can reproduce certain words using simple vector math, for example, king \u2013 man + woman = queen.

In practice, we are interested in those topics that LDA found in the bag-of-words matrix. The only downside may be that we must define the number of topics beforehand\u2014the number of topics is a hyperparameter of LDA that has to be specified manually. LDA with scikit-learn In this subsection, we will use the LatentDirichletAllocation class implemented in scikit-learn to decompose the movie review dataset and categorize it into different topics. In the following example, we will restrict the analysis to 10 different topics, but readers are encouraged to experiment with the hyperparameters of the algorithm to further explore the topics that can be found in this dataset. First, we are going to load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame using the local movie_data.csv file of the movie reviews that we created at the beginning of this chapter: >>> import pandas as pd >>> df = pd.read_csv('movie_data.csv', encoding='utf-8') >>> # the following is necessary on some computers: >>> df = df.rename(columns={\"0\": \"review\", \"1\": \"sentiment\"}) Next, we are going to use the already familiar CountVectorizer to create the bag-of-words matrix as input to the LDA.

The rationale behind the removal of frequently occurring words is that these might be common words appearing across all documents that are, therefore, less likely to be associated with a specific topic category of a given document. Also, we limited the number of words to be considered to the most frequently occurring 5,000 words (max_features=5000), to limit the dimensionality of this dataset to improve the inference performed by LDA.

A fun freakfest at that, but at times it was a tad too reliant on kitsch rather than the horror. The story is difficult to summarize succinctly: a carefree, normal teenage girl starts coming fac ... Using the preceding code example, we printed the first 300 characters from the top three horror mov- ies. The reviews\u2014even though we don\u2019t know which exact movie they belong to\u2014sound like reviews of horror movies (however, one might argue that Horror movie #2 could also be a good fit for topic category 1: Generally bad movies). Summary In this chapter, you learned how to use machine learning algorithms to classify text documents based on their polarity, which is a basic task in sentiment analysis in the field of NLP. Not only did you learn how to encode a document as a feature vector using the bag-of-words model, but you also learned how to weight the term frequency by relevance using tf-idf. Working with text data can be computationally quite expensive due to the large feature vectors that are created during this process; in the last section, we covered how to utilize out-of-core or incremental learning to train a machine learning algorithm without loading the whole dataset into a computer\u2019s memory. Lastly, you were introduced to the concept of topic modeling using LDA to categorize the movie reviews into different categories in an unsupervised fashion. So far, in this book, we have covered many machine learning concepts, best practices, and supervised models for classification. In the next chapter, we will look at another subcategory of supervised learn- ing, regression analysis, which lets us predict outcome variables on a continuous scale, in contrast to the categorical class labels of the classification models that we have been working with so far.

In this chapter, we will dive into another subcategory of supervised learning: regression analysis. Regression models are used to predict target variables on a continuous scale, which makes them attractive for addressing many questions in science. They also have applications in industry, such as understanding relationships between variables, evaluating trends, or making forecasts. One example is predicting the sales of a company in future months. In this chapter, we will discuss the main concepts of regression models and cover the following topics: \u2022 Exploring and visualizing datasets \u2022 Looking at different approaches to implementing linear regression models \u2022 Training regression models that are robust to outliers \u2022 Evaluating regression models and diagnosing common problems \u2022 Fitting regression models to nonlinear data Introducing linear regression The goal of linear regression is to model the relationship between one or multiple features and a con- tinuous target variable. In contrast to classification\u2014a different subcategory of supervised learning\u2014 regression analysis aims to predict outputs on a continuous scale rather than categorical class labels.

The dataset was collected by Dean De Cock in 2011, and additional information is available via the following links: \u2022 A report describing the dataset: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf \u2022 Detailed documentation regarding the dataset\u2019s features: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/ decock/DataDocumentation.txt \u2022 The dataset in a tab-separated format: http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing. txt As with each new dataset, it is always helpful to explore the data through a simple visualization, to get a better feeling of what we are working with, which is what we will do in the following subsections. Loading the Ames Housing dataset into a DataFrame In this section, we will load the Ames Housing dataset using the pandas read_csv function, which is fast and versatile and a recommended tool for working with tabular data stored in a plaintext format. The Ames Housing dataset consists of 2,930 examples and 80 features. For simplicity, we will only work with a subset of the features, shown in the following list. However, if you are curious, follow the link to the full dataset description provided at the beginning of this section, and you are encouraged to explore other variables in this dataset after reading this chapter. The features we will be working with, including the target variable, are as follows: \u2022 Overall Qual: Rating for the overall material and finish of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) \u2022 Overall Cond: Rating for the overall condition of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent) \u2022 Gr Liv Area: Above grade (ground) living area in square feet \u2022 Central Air: Central air conditioning (N=no, Y=yes) \u2022 Total Bsmt SF: Total square feet of the basement area \u2022 SalePrice: Sale price in U.S. dollars ($) For the rest of this chapter, we will regard the sale price (SalePrice) as our target variable\u2014the vari- able that we want to predict using one or more of the five explanatory variables.

In the rest of this section, we will use some simple yet useful techniques from the graphical EDA toolbox that may help us to visually detect the presence of outliers, the dis- tribution of the data, and the relationships between features. First, we will create a scatterplot matrix that allows us to visualize the pair-wise correlations be- tween the different features in this dataset in one place. To plot the scatterplot matrix, we will use the scatterplotmatrix function from the mlxtend library (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/), which is a Python library that contains various convenience functions for machine learning and data science applications in Python. You can install the mlxtend package via conda install mlxtend or pip install mlxtend. For this chapter, we used mlxtend version 0.19.0. Once the installation is complete, you can import the package and create the scatterplot matrix as follows: >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> from mlxtend.plotting import scatterplotmatrix >>> scatterplotmatrix(df.values, figsize=(12, 10), ... names=df.columns, alpha=0.5) >>> plt.tight_layout() plt.show()", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 303, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Looking at relationships using a correlation matrix In the previous section, we visualized the data distributions of the Ames Housing dataset variables in the form of histograms and scatterplots. Next, we will create a correlation matrix to quantify and summarize linear relationships between variables. A correlation matrix is closely related to the covari- ance matrix that we covered in the section Unsupervised dimensionality reduction via principal component analysis in Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. We can interpret the correlation matrix as being a rescaled version of the covariance matrix. In fact, the correlation matrix is identical to a covariance matrix computed from standardized features. The correlation matrix is a square matrix that contains the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (often abbreviated as Pearson\u2019s r), which measures the linear dependence between pairs of features. The correlation coefficients are in the range \u20131 to 1. Two features have a perfect positive correlation if r = 1, no correlation if r = 0, and a perfect negative correlation if r = \u20131. As mentioned previously, Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient can simply be calculated as the covariance between two features, x and y (numerator), divided by the product of their standard deviations (denominator): \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \u2211 [(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65)(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66)] \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u221a\u2211 (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65)2 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u221a\u2211 (\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66) 2 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 Here, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 denotes the mean of the corresponding feature, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 is the covariance between the features x and y, and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 are the features\u2019 standard deviations.

The normality assumption is only a requirement for certain statistics and hypothesis tests that are beyond the scope of this book (for more information on this topic, please refer to Introduction to Linear Regression Analysis by Douglas C.

Looking at the previous correlation matrix, we can see that SalePrice shows the largest correlation with the Gr Liv Area variable (0.71), which seems to be a good choice for an exploratory variable to introduce the concepts of a simple linear regression model in the fol- lowing section. Implementing an ordinary least squares linear regression model At the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that linear regression can be understood as obtaining the best-fitting straight line through the examples of our training data. However, we have neither defined the term best-fitting nor have we discussed the different techniques of fitting such a model. In the following subsections, we will fill in the missing pieces of this puzzle using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method (sometimes also called linear least squares) to estimate the parameters of the linear regression line that minimizes the sum of the squared vertical distances (residuals or errors) to the training examples. Solving regression for regression parameters with gradient descent Consider our implementation of the Adaptive Linear Neuron (Adaline) from Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification.

Furthermore, we will standardize the variables for better convergence of the GD algorithm. The code is as follows: >>> X = df[['Gr Liv Area']].values >>> y = df['SalePrice'].values >>> from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler >>> sc_x = StandardScaler() >>> sc_y = StandardScaler() >>> X_std = sc_x.fit_transform(X) >>> y_std = sc_y.fit_transform(y[:, np.newaxis]).flatten() >>> lr = LinearRegressionGD(eta=0.1) >>> lr.fit(X_std, y_std) Notice the workaround regarding y_std, using np.newaxis and flatten.

In the previous code ex- ample, the use of np.newaxis in y[:, np.newaxis] added a new dimension to the array.

Later in this chapter, we will discuss how to quantify the per- formance of a regression model. Interestingly, we can also observe several outliers, for example, the three data points corresponding to a standardized living area greater than 6. We will discuss how we can deal with outliers later in this chapter. In certain applications, it may also be important to report the predicted outcome variables on their original scale. To scale the predicted price back onto the original price in U.S. dollars scale, we can simply apply the inverse_transform method of StandardScaler: >>> feature_std = sc_x.transform(np.array([[2500]])) >>> target_std = lr.predict(feature_std) >>> target_reverted = sc_y.inverse_transform(target_std.reshape(-1, 1)) >>> print(f'Sales price: ${target_reverted.flatten()[0]:.2f}') Sales price: $292507.07", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 311, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As a side note, it is also worth mentioning that we technically don\u2019t have to update the intercept pa- rameter (for instance, the bias unit, b) if we are working with standardized variables, since the y axis intercept is always 0 in those cases.

For example, many of scikit-learn\u2019s estimators for regression make use of the least squares implementation in SciPy (scipy.linalg.lstsq), which, in turn, uses highly optimized code optimizations based on the Linear Algebra Package (LAPACK). The linear regression implementation in scikit-learn also works (better) with unstandardized variables, since it does not use (S)GD-based optimization, so we can skip the standardization step: >>> from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression >>> slr = LinearRegression() >>> slr.fit(X, y) >>> y_pred = slr.predict(X) >>> print(f'Slope: {slr.coef_[0]:.3f}') Slope: 111.666 >>> print(f'Intercept: {slr.intercept_:.3f}') Intercept: 13342.979 As you can see from executing this code, scikit-learn\u2019s LinearRegression model, fitted with the un- standardized Gr Liv Area and SalePrice variables, yielded different model coefficients, since the features have not been standardized. However, when we compare it to our GD implementation by plotting SalePrice against Gr Liv Area, we can qualitatively see that it fits the data similarly well: >>> lin_regplot(X, y, slr) >>> plt.xlabel('Living area above ground in square feet') >>> plt.ylabel('Sale price in U.S. dollars') >>> plt.tight_layout() >>> plt.show()", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 312, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In certain situations, a very small subset of our data can have a big effect on the estimated model coefficients. Many statistical tests can be used to detect outliers, but these are beyond the scope of the book. However, removing outliers always requires our own judgment as data scientists as well as our domain knowledge. As an alternative to throwing out outliers, we will look at a robust method of regression using the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which fits a regression model to a subset of the data, the so-called inliers. We can summarize the iterative RANSAC algorithm as follows: 1. Select a random number of examples to be inliers and fit the model. 2. Test all other data points against the fitted model and add those points that fall within a us- er-given tolerance to the inliers. 3. Refit the model using all inliers. 4. Estimate the error of the fitted model versus the inliers. 5. Terminate the algorithm if the performance meets a certain user-defined threshold or if a fixed number of iterations was reached; go back to step 1 otherwise. The advantage of this method is that it is guaranteed to find the optimal solution analyti- cally. However, if we are working with very large datasets, it can be computationally too expensive to invert the matrix in this formula (sometimes also called the normal equation), or the matrix containing the training examples may be singular (non-invertible), which is why we may prefer iterative methods in certain cases. If you are interested in more information on how to obtain normal equations, take a look at Dr. Stephen Pollock\u2019s chapter The Classical Linear Regression Model, from his lectures at the University of Leicester, which is available for free at http://www.le.ac.uk/users/ dsgp1/COURSES/MESOMET/ECMETXT/06mesmet.pdf. Also, if you want to compare linear regression solutions obtained via GD, SGD, the closed-form solution, QR factorization, and singular vector decomposition, you can use the LinearRegression class implemented in mlxtend (http://rasbt.github.io/ mlxtend/user_guide/regressor/LinearRegression/), which lets users toggle between these options. Another great library to recommend for regression modeling in Python is statsmodels, which implements more advanced linear regression models, as illustrated at https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/examples/index.html#regression.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 314, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

By default (via residual_threshold=None), scikit-learn uses the MAD estimate to select the inlier threshold, where MAD stands for the median absolute deviation of the target values, y. However, the choice of an appropriate value for the inlier threshold is problem-specific, which is one disadvantage of RANSAC. Many different approaches have been developed in recent years to select a good inlier threshold au- tomatically.

Thus, in the next section, we will look at different approaches for evaluating a regression model, which is a crucial part of building systems for predictive modeling. Evaluating the performance of linear regression models In the previous section, you learned how to fit a regression model on training data. However, you discovered in previous chapters that it is crucial to test the model on data that it hasn\u2019t seen during training to obtain a more unbiased estimate of its generalization performance. As you may remember from Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparam- eter Tuning, we want to split our dataset into separate training and test datasets, where we will use the former to fit the model and the latter to evaluate its performance on unseen data to estimate the generalization performance. Instead of proceeding with the simple regression model, we will now use all five features in the dataset and train a multiple regression model: >>> from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split >>> target = 'SalePrice' >>> features = df.columns[df.columns != target] >>> X = df[features].values >>> y = df[target].values", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 317, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Residual plots are a commonly used graphical tool for diagnosing regression models. They can help to detect nonlinearity and outliers and check whether the errors are randomly distributed. Using the following code, we will now plot a residual plot where we simply subtract the true target variables from our predicted responses: >>> x_max = np.max( ...

However, for a good regression model, we would expect the errors to be randomly distributed and the residuals to be randomly scattered around the centerline. If we see patterns in a residual plot, it means that our model is unable to capture some ex- planatory information, which has leaked into the residuals, as you can see to a degree in our previous residual plot. Furthermore, we can also use residual plots to detect outliers, which are represented by the points with a large deviation from the centerline. Another useful quantitative measure of a model\u2019s performance is the mean squared error (MSE) that we discussed earlier as our loss function that we minimized to fit the linear regression model. The following is a version of the MSE without the 1 2 scaling factor that is often used to simplify the loss derivative in gradient descent: \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc401 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\u2211(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)2 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Similar to prediction accuracy in classification contexts, we can use the MSE for cross-validation and model selection as discussed in Chapter 6. Like classification accuracy, MSE also normalizes according to the sample size, n. This makes it pos- sible to compare across different sample sizes (for example, in the context of learning curves) as well. Let\u2019s now compute the MSE of our training and test predictions: >>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error >>> mse_train = mean_squared_error(y_train, y_train_pred) >>> mse_test = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_test_pred)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 319, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Note that it can be more intuitive to show the error on the original unit scale (here, dollar instead of dollar-squared), which is why we may choose to compute the square root of the MSE, called root mean squared error, or the mean absolute error (MAE), which emphasizes incorrect prediction slightly less: \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc401 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\u2211|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56| \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 We can compute the MAE similar to the MSE: >>> from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error >>> mae_train = mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_train_pred) >>> mae_test = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_test_pred) >>> print(f'MAE train: {mae_train:.2f}') MAE train: 25983.03 >>> print(f'MAE test: {mae_test:.2f}') MAE test: 24921.29 Based on the test set MAE, we can say that the model makes an error of approximately $25,000 on average. When we use the MAE or MSE for comparing models, we need to be aware that these are unbounded in contrast to the classification accuracy, for example. In other words, the interpretations of the MAE and MSE depend on the dataset and feature scaling. For example, if the sale prices were presented as multiples of 1,000 (with the K suffix), the same model would yield a lower MAE compared to a model that worked with unscaled features. To further illustrate this point, |$500K \u2212 550K| < |$500,000 \u2212 550,000| Thus, it may sometimes be more useful to report the coefficient of determination (R 2), which can be understood as a standardized version of the MSE, for better interpretability of the model\u2019s perfor- mance. Or, in other words, R 2 is the fraction of response variance that is captured by the model.

A negative R 2 means that the regression model fits the data worse than a horizontal line representing the sample mean. (In practice, this often happens in the case of extreme overfitting, or if we forget to scale the test set in the same manner we scaled the training set.) If R 2 = 1, the model fits the data perfectly with a corresponding MSE = 0. Evaluated on the training data, the R 2 of our model is 0.77, which isn\u2019t great but also not too bad giv- en that we only work with a small set of features. However, the R 2 on the test dataset is only slightly smaller, at 0.75, which indicates that the model is only overfitting slightly: >>> from sklearn.metrics import r2_score >>> train_r2 = r2_score(y_train, y_train_pred) >>> test_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_test_pred) >>> print(f'R^2 train: {train_r2:.3f}, {test_r2:.3f}') R^2 train: 0.77, test: 0.75 Using regularized methods for regression As we discussed in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, regularization is one approach to tackling the problem of overfitting by adding additional information and thereby shrinking the parameter values of the model to induce a penalty against complexity. The most popular approaches to regularized linear regression are the so-called ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 321, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

This may be undesirable in certain applications of feature selection. In practice, however, this property of LASSO is often an advantage because it avoids saturated models. The satura- tion of a model occurs if the number of training examples is equal to the number of features, which is a form of overparameterization. As a consequence, a saturated model can always fit the training data perfectly but is merely a form of interpolation and thus is not expected to generalize well. A compromise between ridge regression and LASSO is elastic net, which has an L1 penalty to generate sparsity and an L2 penalty such that it can be used for selecting more than n features if m > n: \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98)\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= \u2211(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212 \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)) 2 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf062||\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc982 2 + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf061||\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc98\ud835\udc981 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Those regularized regression models are all available via scikit-learn, and their usage is similar to the regular regression model except that we have to specify the regularization strength via the parameter \ud835\udf06\ud835\udf06, for example, optimized via k-fold cross-validation.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 322, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Turning a linear regression model into a curve \u2013 polynomial regression In the previous sections, we assumed a linear relationship between explanatory and response vari- ables. One way to account for the violation of linearity assumption is to use a polynomial regression model by adding polynomial terms: \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc661\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652 + \u2026 + \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51+ \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f Here, d denotes the degree of the polynomial. Although we can use polynomial regression to model a nonlinear relationship, it is still considered a multiple linear regression model because of the linear regression coefficients, w. In the following subsections, we will see how we can add such polynomial terms to an existing dataset conveniently and fit a polynomial regression model. Adding polynomial terms using scikit-learn We will now learn how to use the PolynomialFeatures transformer class from scikit-learn to add a quadratic term (d = 2) to a simple regression problem with one explanatory variable. Then, we will compare the polynomial to the linear fit by following these steps:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 323, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The Overall Qual variable rates the overall quality of the material and finish of the houses and is given on a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is best: >>> X = df[['Overall Qual']].values >>> y = df['SalePrice'].values After specifying the X and y variables, we can reuse the previous code and obtain the plot in Figure 9.14: Figure 9.14: A linear, quadratic, and cubic fit on the sale price and house quality data As you can see, the quadratic and cubic fits capture the relationship between sale prices and the overall quality of the house better than the linear fit. However, you should be aware that adding more and more polynomial features increases the complexity of a model and therefore increases the chance of overfitting. Thus, in practice, it is always recommended to evaluate the performance of the model on a separate test dataset to estimate the generalization performance. Dealing with nonlinear relationships using random forests In this section, we are going to look at random forest regression, which is conceptually different from the previous regression models in this chapter. A random forest, which is an ensemble of multiple decision trees, can be understood as the sum of piecewise linear functions, in contrast to the global linear and polynomial regression models that we discussed previously.

(Likewise, normalizing or standardizing features is not required for decision trees.) As mentioned in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, we grow a decision tree by iteratively splitting its nodes until the leaves are pure or a stopping criterion is satisfied. When we used decision trees for classification, we defined entropy as a measure of impurity to determine which feature split maximizes the information gain (IG), which can be defined as follows for a binary split: \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c(\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d) \u2212\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59) \u2212\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f) Here, xi is the feature to perform the split, Np is the number of training examples in the parent node, I is the impurity function, Dp is the subset of training examples at the parent node, and Dleft and Dright are the subsets of training examples at the left and right child nodes after the split. Remember that our goal is to find the feature split that maximizes the information gain; in other words, we want to find the feature split that reduces the impurities in the child nodes most. In Chapter 3, we discussed Gini impurity and entropy as measures of impurity, which are both useful criteria for classification. To use a decision tree for regression, however, we need an impurity metric that is suitable for continuous variables, so we define the impurity measure of a node, t, as the MSE instead: \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2211(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)2 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 Here, Nt is the number of training examples at node t, Dt is the training subset at node t, \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the true target value, and \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u0302 is the predicted target value (sample mean): \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= 1 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \u2211\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 In the context of decision tree regression, the MSE is often referred to as within-node variance, which is why the splitting criterion is also better known as variance reduction. To see what the line fit of a decision tree looks like, let\u2019s use the DecisionTreeRegressor implemented in scikit-learn to model the relationship between the SalePrice and Gr Living Area variables. Note that SalePrice and Gr Living Area do not necessarily represent a nonlinear relationship, but this feature combination still demonstrates the general aspects of a regression tree quite nicely: >>> from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor >>> X = df[['Gr Liv Area']].values >>> y = df['SalePrice'].values >>> tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3) >>> tree.fit(X, y)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 329, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

And we can imagine that a regression tree could also capture trends in nonlinear data relatively well. However, a limitation of this model is that it does not capture the continuity and differentiability of the desired prediction. In addition, we need to be careful about choosing an appropriate value for the depth of the tree so as to not overfit or underfit the data; here, a depth of three seemed to be a good choice. Figure 9.15: A decision tree regression plot You are encouraged to experiment with deeper decision trees. Note that the relationship between Gr Living Area and SalePrice is rather linear, so you are also encouraged to apply the decision tree to the Overall Qual variable instead. In the next section, we will look at a more robust way of fitting regression trees: random forests. Random forest regression As you learned in Chapter 3, the random forest algorithm is an ensemble technique that combines multiple decision trees. A random forest usually has a better generalization performance than an individual decision tree due to randomness, which helps to decrease the model\u2019s variance. Other ad- vantages of random forests are that they are less sensitive to outliers in the dataset and don\u2019t require much parameter tuning. The only parameter in random forests that we typically need to experiment with is the number of trees in the ensemble. The basic random forest algorithm for regression is almost identical to the random forest algorithm for classification that we discussed in Chapter 3. The only difference is that we use the MSE criterion to grow the individual decision trees, and the predicted target variable is calculated as the average prediction across all decision trees.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 330, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In other words, the error of the predic- tions should not be related to any of the information contained in the explanatory variables; rather, it should reflect the randomness of the real-world distributions or patterns. If we find patterns in the prediction errors, for example, by inspecting the residual plot, it means that the residual plots contain predictive information. A common reason for this could be that explanatory information is leaking into those residuals. Unfortunately, there is not a universal approach for dealing with non-randomness in residual plots, and it requires experimentation. Depending on the data that is available to us, we may be able to improve the model by transforming variables, tuning the hyperparameters of the learning algorithm, choosing simpler or more complex models, removing outliers, or including additional variables. Summary At the beginning of this chapter, you learned about simple linear regression analysis to model the relationship between a single explanatory variable and a continuous response variable. We then dis- cussed a useful explanatory data analysis technique to look at patterns and anomalies in data, which is an important first step in predictive modeling tasks. We built our first model by implementing linear regression using a gradient-based optimization ap- proach. You then saw how to utilize scikit-learn\u2019s linear models for regression and also implement a robust regression technique (RANSAC) as an approach for dealing with outliers. To assess the predictive performance of regression models, we computed the mean sum of squared errors and the related R 2 metric. Furthermore, we also discussed a useful graphical approach for diagnosing the problems of regression models: the residual plot. After we explored how regularization can be applied to regression models to reduce the model com- plexity and avoid overfitting, we also covered several approaches for modeling nonlinear relationships, including polynomial feature transformation and random forest regressors. We discussed supervised learning, classification, and regression analysis in detail in the previous chapters. In the next chapter, we are going to learn about another interesting subfield of machine learning, unsupervised learning, and also how to use cluster analysis to find hidden structures in data in the absence of target variables.

The goal of clustering is to find a natural grouping in data so that items in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those from different clusters. Given its exploratory nature, clustering is an exciting topic, and in this chapter, you will learn about the following concepts, which can help us to organize data into meaningful structures: \u2022 Finding centers of similarity using the popular k-means algorithm \u2022 Taking a bottom-up approach to building hierarchical clustering trees \u2022 Identifying arbitrary shapes of objects using a density-based clustering approach Grouping objects by similarity using k-means In this section, we will learn about one of the most popular clustering algorithms, k-means, which is widely used in academia as well as in industry. Clustering (or cluster analysis) is a technique that allows us to find groups of similar objects that are more related to each other than to objects in other groups. Examples of business-oriented applications of clustering include the grouping of documents, music, and movies by different topics, or finding customers that share similar interests based on common purchase behaviors as a basis for recommendation engines. k-means clustering using scikit-learn As you will see in a moment, the k-means algorithm is extremely easy to implement, but it is also com- putationally very efficient compared to other clustering algorithms, which might explain its popularity.

Prototype-based clustering means that each cluster is represented by a prototype, which is usually either the centroid (average) of similar points with continuous features, or the medoid (the most representative or the point that minimizes the distance to all other points that belong to a particular cluster) in the case of categorical features. While k-means is very good at identifying clusters with a spherical shape, one of the drawbacks of this clustering algorithm is that we have to specify the number of clusters, k, a priori. An inappropriate choice for k can result in poor clustering performance. Later in this chapter, we will discuss the elbow method and silhouette plots, which are useful techniques to evaluate the quality of a clustering to help us determine the optimal number of clusters, k. Although k-means clustering can be applied to data in higher dimensions, we will walk through the following examples using a simple two-dimensional dataset for the purpose of visualization: >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs >>> X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=150, ... n_features=2, ... centers=3, ... cluster_std=0.5, ... shuffle=True, ... random_state=0) >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> plt.scatter(X[:, 0], ...

Thus, our goal is to group the examples based on their feature similarities, which can be achieved using the k-means algorithm, as summarized by the following four steps: 1. Randomly pick k centroids from the examples as initial cluster centers 2.

We set n_init=10 to run the k-means clustering algorithms 10 times independently, with different random centroids to choose the final model as the one with the lowest SSE. Via the max_iter parameter, we specify the maximum number of iterations for each single run (here, 300). Note that the k-means implementation in scikit-learn stops early if it converges before the maximum number of iterations is reached. However, it is possible that k-means does not reach convergence for a particular run, which can be problematic (computationally expen- sive) if we choose relatively large values for max_iter. One way to deal with convergence problems is to choose larger values for tol, which is a parameter that controls the tolerance with regard to the changes in the within-cluster SSE to declare convergence. In the preceding code, we chose a tolerance of 1e-04 (=0.0001). A problem with k-means is that one or more clusters can be empty. Note that this problem does not exist for k-medoids or fuzzy C-means, an algorithm that we will discuss later in this section. However, this problem is accounted for in the current k-means implementation in scikit-learn. If a cluster is empty, the algorithm will search for the example that is farthest away from the centroid of the empty cluster. Then, it will reassign the centroid to be this farthest point.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 337, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The number of clusters to choose may not always be so obvious in real-world applications, especially if we are working with a higher-dimensional dataset that cannot be visualized. The other properties of k-means are that clusters do not overlap and are not hierar- chical, and we also assume that there is at least one item in each cluster. Later in this chapter, we will encounter different types of clustering algorithms, hierarchical and density-based clustering. Neither type of algorithm requires us to specify the number of clusters upfront or assume spherical structures in our dataset. In the next subsection, we will cover a popular variant of the classic k-means algorithm called k-means++. While it doesn\u2019t address those assumptions and drawbacks of k-means that were discussed in the previous paragraph, it can greatly improve the clustering results through more clever seeding of the initial cluster centers. A smarter way of placing the initial cluster centroids using k-means++ So far, we have discussed the classic k-means algorithm, which uses a random seed to place the initial centroids, which can sometimes result in bad clusterings or slow convergence if the initial centroids are chosen poorly.

Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii in Proceedings of the eighteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms, pages 1027-1035. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2007). The initialization in k-means++ can be summarized as follows: 1. Initialize an empty set, M, to store the k centroids being selected. 2. Randomly choose the first centroid, \ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57), from the input examples and assign it to M. 3.

For instance, we collect all points in an array and choose a weighted random sam- pling, such that the larger the squared distance, the more likely a point gets chosen as the centroid. 5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until k centroids are chosen. 6. Proceed with the classic k-means algorithm. To use k-means++ with scikit-learn\u2019s KMeans object, we just need to set the init parameter to 'k-means++'. In fact, 'k-means++' is the default argument to the init parameter, which is strongly recommended in practice. The only reason we didn\u2019t use it in the previous example was to not introduce too many concepts all at once. The rest of this section on k-means will use k-means++, but you are encouraged to experiment more with the two different approaches (classic k-means via init='random' versus k-means++ via init='k-means++') for placing the initial cluster centroids. Hard versus soft clustering Hard clustering describes a family of algorithms where each example in a dataset is assigned to exactly one cluster, as in the k-means and k-means++ algorithms that we discussed earlier in this chapter. In contrast, algorithms for soft clustering (sometimes also called fuzzy clustering) assign an example to one or more clusters. A popular example of soft clustering is the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm (also called soft k-means or fuzzy k-means). The original idea goes back to the 1970s, when Joseph C. Dunn first proposed an early version of fuzzy clustering to improve k-means (A Fuzzy Relative of the ISODATA Process and Its Use in Detecting Compact Well-Separated Clusters, 1973). Almost a decade later, James C. Bedzek published his work on the improvement of the fuzzy clustering algorithm, which is now known as the FCM algorithm (Pattern Recognition with Fuzzy Objective Function Algorithms, Springer Science+Business Media, 2013). The FCM procedure is very similar to k-means. However, we replace the hard cluster assignment with probabilities for each point belonging to each cluster. In k-means, we could express the cluster membership of an example, x, with a sparse vector of binary values: [ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(1) \u2192 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = 0 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(2) \u2192 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = 1 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(3) \u2192 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = 0 ]", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 340, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

You also may have noticed that we added an additional exponent to w (i, j); the exponent m, any number greater than or equal to one (typically m = 2), is the so-called fuzziness coefficient (or simply fuzzifier), which controls the degree of fuzziness. The larger the value of m, the smaller the cluster membership, w (i, j), becomes, which leads to fuzzier clusters. The cluster membership probability itself is calculated as follows: \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = [\u2211( \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57)\u20162 \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50)\u20162 ) 2 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 ] \u22121 For example, if we chose three cluster centers, as in the previous k-means example, we could calculate the membership of \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) belonging to the \ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57) cluster as follows: \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = [( \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57)\u20162 \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(1)\u20162 ) 2 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a + ( \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57)\u20162 \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(2)\u20162 ) 2 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a + ( \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57)\u20162 \u2016\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41(3)\u20162 ) 2 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a ] \u22121", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 341, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

On the other hand, FCM typically requires fewer iterations overall to reach convergence. However, it has been found, in practice, that both k-means and FCM produce very similar clustering outputs, as described in a study (Comparative Analysis of k-means and Fuzzy C-Means Algorithms by S. Ghosh and S. K. Dubey, IJACSA, 4: 35\u201338, 2013). Unfortu- nately, the FCM algorithm is not implemented in scikit-learn currently, but interested readers can try out the FCM implementation from the scikit-fuzzy package, which is available at https://github. com/scikit-fuzzy/scikit-fuzzy. Using the elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters One of the main challenges in unsupervised learning is that we do not know the definitive answer. We don\u2019t have the ground-truth class labels in our dataset that allow us to apply the techniques that we used in Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, to evaluate the performance of a supervised model. Thus, to quantify the quality of clustering, we need to use intrinsic metrics\u2014such as the within-cluster SSE (distortion)\u2014to compare the performance of different k-means clustering models. Conveniently, we don\u2019t need to compute the within-cluster SSE explicitly when we are using scikit-learn, as it is already accessible via the inertia_ attribute after fitting a KMeans model: >>> print(f'Distortion: {km.inertia_:.2f}') Distortion: 72.48 Based on the within-cluster SSE, we can use a graphical tool, the so-called elbow method, to estimate the optimal number of clusters, k, for a given task. We can say that if k increases, the distortion will decrease. This is because the examples will be closer to the centroids they are assigned to. The idea behind the elbow method is to identify the value of k where the distortion begins to increase most rapidly, which will become clearer if we plot the distortion for different values of k: >>> distortions = [] >>> for i in range(1, 11): ... km = KMeans(n_clusters=i, ... init='k-means++', ... n_init=10, ... max_iter=300, ... random_state=0) ... km.fit(X) ... distortions.append(km.inertia_)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 342, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Sil- houette analysis can be used as a graphical tool to plot a measure of how tightly grouped the examples in the clusters are. To calculate the silhouette coefficient of a single example in our dataset, we can apply the following three steps: 1. Calculate the cluster cohesion, a (i), as the average distance between an example, x (i), and all other points in the same cluster. 2. Calculate the cluster separation, b (i), from the next closest cluster as the average distance between the example, x (i), and all examples in the nearest cluster. 3. Calculate the silhouette, s (i), as the difference between cluster cohesion and separation divided by the greater of the two, as shown here: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2212\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a{\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)}", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 343, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Based on the preceding equation, we can see that the silhouette coefficient is 0 if the cluster separation and cohesion are equal (b (i) = a (i)). Furthermore, we get close to an ideal silhouette coefficient of 1 if b (i) >> a (i), since b (i) quantifies how dissimilar an example is from other clusters, and a (i) tells us how similar it is to the other examples in its own cluster. The silhouette coefficient is available as silhouette_samples from scikit-learn\u2019s metric module, and optionally, the silhouette_scores function can be imported for convenience. The silhouette_scores function calculates the average silhouette coefficient across all examples, which is equivalent to numpy. mean(silhouette_samples(...)).

In divisive hierarchical clustering, we start with one cluster that encompasses the complete dataset, and we iteratively split the cluster into smaller clusters until each cluster only contains one example. In this section, we will focus on agglomerative clustering, which takes the opposite approach. We start with each example as an individual cluster and merge the closest pairs of clusters until only one cluster remains. Grouping clusters in a bottom-up fashion The two standard algorithms for agglomerative hierarchical clustering are single linkage and complete linkage. Using single linkage, we compute the distances between the most similar members for each pair of clusters and merge the two clusters for which the distance between the most similar members is the smallest. The complete linkage approach is similar to single linkage but, instead of comparing the most similar members in each pair of clusters, we compare the most dissimilar members to per- form the merge. This is shown in Figure 10.7: Figure 10.7: The complete linkage approach In this section, we will focus on agglomerative clustering using the complete linkage approach. Hier- archical complete linkage clustering is an iterative procedure that can be summarized by the following steps: 1. Compute a pair-wise distance matrix of all examples. 2. Represent each data point as a singleton cluster. Alternative types of linkages Other commonly used algorithms for agglomerative hierarchical clustering include average linkage and Ward\u2019s linkage.

As its name implies, den- sity-based clustering assigns cluster labels based on dense regions of points. In DBSCAN, the notion of density is defined as the number of points within a specified radius, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 . According to the DBSCAN algorithm, a special label is assigned to each example (data point) using the following criteria: \u2022 A point is considered a core point if at least a specified number (MinPts) of neighboring points fall within the specified radius, \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 \u2022 A border point is a point that has fewer neighbors than MinPts within \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 , but lies within the \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 radius of a core point \u2022 All other points that are neither core nor border points are considered noise points", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 357, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

With an increasing number of features in our dataset\u2014assuming a fixed number of training examples\u2014the negative effect of the curse of dimensionality increases. This is especially a problem if we are using the Euclidean distance metric. However, the problem of the curse of dimensionality is not unique to DBSCAN: it also affects other clustering algorithms that use the Euclidean distance metric, for example, k-means and hier- archical clustering algorithms. In addition, we have two hyperparameters in DBSCAN (MinPts and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 ) that need to be optimized to yield good clustering results. Finding a good combination of MinPts and \ud835\udf00\ud835\udf00 can be problematic if the density differences in the dataset are relatively large. Graph-based clustering So far, we have seen three of the most fundamental categories of clustering algorithms: prototype-based clustering with k-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, and den- sity-based clustering via DBSCAN. However, there is also a fourth class of more advanced clustering algorithms that we have not covered in this chapter: graph-based clustering. Probably the most prominent members of the graph-based clustering family are the spec- tral clustering algorithms. Although there are many different implementations of spectral clustering, what they all have in common is that they use the eigenvectors of a similarity or distance matrix to derive the cluster relationships. Since spectral clustering is beyond the scope of this book, you can read the excellent tutorial by Ulrike von Luxburg to learn more about this topic (A tutorial on spectral clustering, Statistics and Computing, 17(4): 395-416, 2007).

Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that a successful clustering does not only depend on the algorithm and its hyperparameters; rather, the choice of an appropriate distance metric and the use of domain knowledge that can help to guide the experimental setup can be even more important. In the context of the curse of dimensionality, it is thus common practice to apply dimensionality reduction techniques prior to performing clustering. Such dimensionality reduction techniques for unsupervised datasets include principal component analysis and t-SNE, which we covered in Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. Also, it is particularly common to compress datasets down to two-dimensional subspaces, which allows us to visualize the clusters and assigned labels using two-dimensional scatterplots, which are particularly helpful for evaluating the results. Summary In this chapter, you learned about three different clustering algorithms that can help us with the discovery of hidden structures or information in data. We started with a prototype-based approach, k-means, which clusters examples into spherical shapes based on a specified number of cluster cen- troids. Since clustering is an unsupervised method, we do not enjoy the luxury of ground-truth labels to evaluate the performance of a model. Thus, we used intrinsic performance metrics, such as the elbow method or silhouette analysis, as an attempt to quantify the quality of clustering. We then looked at a different approach to clustering: agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Hierar- chical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters upfront, and the result can be visualized in a dendrogram representation, which can help with the interpretation of the results. The last clustering algorithm that we covered in this chapter was DBSCAN, an algorithm that groups points based on local densities and is capable of handling outliers and identifying non-globular shapes. After this excursion into the field of unsupervised learning, it is now time to introduce some of the most exciting machine learning algorithms for supervised learning: multilayer artificial neural networks. After their recent resurgence, neural networks are once again the hottest topic in machine learning research. Thanks to recently developed deep learning algorithms, neural networks are considered state of the art for many complex tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. In Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch, we will construct our own multilayer neural network. In Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, we will work with the PyTorch library, which specializes in training neural network models with multiple layers very efficiently by utilizing graphics processing units.

Although artificial NNs have gained a lot of popularity in recent years, early studies of NNs go back to the 1940s, when Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts first described how neurons could work. (A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, by W. S. McCulloch and W. Pitts, The Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics, 5(4):115\u2013133, 1943.) However, in the decades that followed the first implementation of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model\u2014Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptron in the 1950s\u2014many researchers and machine learning practitioners slowly began to lose interest in NNs since no one had a good solution for training an NN with multiple layers. Eventually, interest in NNs was rekindled in 1986 when D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton, and R.J. Williams were involved in the (re)discovery and popularization of the backpropagation algorithm to train NNs more efficiently, which we will discuss in more detail later in this chapter (Learning rep- resentations by backpropagating errors, by D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton, and R.J. Williams, Nature, 323 (6088): 533\u2013536, 1986). Readers who are interested in the history of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and NNs are also encouraged to read the Wikipedia article on the so-called AI winters, which are the periods of time where a large portion of the research community lost interest in the study of NNs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter). However, NNs are more popular today than ever thanks to the many breakthroughs that have been made in the previous decade, which resulted in what we now call deep learning algorithms and archi- tectures\u2014NNs that are composed of many layers. NNs are a hot topic not only in academic research but also in big technology companies, such as Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Uber, Google, and many more that invest heavily in artificial NNs and deep learning research. As of today, complex NNs powered by deep learning algorithms are considered state-of-the-art solutions for complex problem solving such as image and voice recognition.

SGD approximates the loss from a single training sample (online learning) or a small subset of training examples (mini-batch learning). We will make use of this concept later in this chapter when we implement and train a multilayer perceptron (MLP). Apart from faster learning\u2014due to the more frequent weight updates compared to gradient descent\u2014its noisy nature is also regarded as beneficial when training multilayer NNs with nonlinear activation functions, which do not have a convex loss function. Here, the added noise can help to escape local loss minima, but we will discuss this topic in more detail later in this chapter. Introducing the multilayer neural network architecture In this section, you will learn how to connect multiple single neurons to a multilayer feedforward NN; this special type of fully connected network is also called MLP.

The units in the hidden layer are fully connected to the input features, and the output layer is fully connected to the hidden layer. If such a network has more than one hidden layer, we also call it a deep NN. (Note that in some contexts, the inputs are also regarded as a layer. However, in this case, it would make the Adaline model, which is a single-layer neural network, a two-layer neural network, which may be counterintuitive.) Adding additional hidden layers We can add any number of hidden layers to the MLP to create deeper network architectures. Practically, we can think of the number of layers and units in an NN as additional hyper- parameters that we want to optimize for a given problem task using the cross-validation technique, which we discussed in Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning. However, the loss gradients for updating the network\u2019s parameters, which we will calcu- late later via backpropagation, will become increasingly small as more layers are added to a network. This vanishing gradient problem makes model learning more challenging.

To make the math and code implementations a bit more intuitive, we will not use numerical indices to refer to layers, but we will use the in superscript for the input features, the h superscript for the hidden layer, and the out superscript for the output layer. For instance, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) refers to the ith input feature value, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\u210e) refers to the ith unit in the hidden layer, and \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c) refers to the ith unit in the output layer. Note that the b\u2019s in Figure 11.2 denote the bias units. In fact, b (h) and b (out) are vectors with the number of elements being equal to the number of nodes in the layer they correspond to. For example, b (h) stores d bias units, where d is the number of nodes in the hidden layer. If this sounds confusing, don\u2019t worry. Looking at the code implementation later, where we initialize weight matrices and bias unit vectors, will help clarify these concepts. Each node in layer l is connected to all nodes in layer l + 1 via a weight coefficient. For example, the connection between the kth unit in layer l to the jth unit in layer l + 1 will be written as \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59). Referring back to Figure 11.2, we denote the weight matrix that connects the input to the hidden layer as W (h), and we write the matrix that connects the hidden layer to the output layer as W (out). While one unit in the output layer would suffice for a binary classification task, we saw a more gen- eral form of an NN in the preceding figure, which allows us to perform multiclass classification via a generalization of the one-versus-all (OvA) technique. To better understand how this works, remember the one-hot representation of categorical variables that we introduced in Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets \u2013 Data Preprocessing. For example, we can encode the three class labels in the familiar Iris dataset (0=Setosa, 1=Versicol- or, 2=Virginica) as follows: 0 = [ 1 0 0 ] , 1 = [ 0 1 0 ] , 2 = [ 0 0 1 ] This one-hot vector representation allows us to tackle classification tasks with an arbitrary number of unique class labels present in the training dataset. If you are new to NN representations, the indexing notation (subscripts and superscripts) may look a little bit confusing at first. What may seem overly complicated at first will make much more sense in later sections when we vectorize the NN representation. As introduced earlier, we summarize the weights that connect the input and hidden layers by a d\u00d7m dimensional matrix W (h), where d is the number of hidden units and m is the number of input units. Activating a neural network via forward propagation In this section, we will describe the process of forward propagation to calculate the output of an MLP model. To understand how it fits into the context of learning an MLP model, let\u2019s summarize the MLP learning procedure in three simple steps: 1. Starting at the input layer, we forward propagate the patterns of the training data through the network to generate an output. 2. Based on the network\u2019s output, we calculate the loss that we want to minimize using a loss function that we will describe later.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 369, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We backpropagate the loss, find its derivative with respect to each weight and bias unit in the network, and update the model. Finally, after we repeat these three steps for multiple epochs and learn the weight and bias parame- ters of the MLP, we use forward propagation to calculate the network output and apply a threshold function to obtain the predicted class labels in the one-hot representation, which we described in the previous section. Now, let\u2019s walk through the individual steps of forward propagation to generate an output from the patterns in the training data. Since each unit in the hidden layer is connected to all units in the input layers, we first calculate the activation unit of the hidden layer \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1 (\u210e) as follows: \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc671 (\u210e) = \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641,1 (\u210e) + \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641,2 (\u210e) + \u22ef+ \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641,\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a (\u210e) \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e1 (\u210e) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e1 (\u210e)) Here, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc671 (\u210e) is the net input and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u22c5) is the activation function, which has to be differentiable to learn the weights that connect the neurons using a gradient-based approach. To be able to solve complex problems such as image classification, we need nonlinear activation functions in our MLP model, for example, the sigmoid (logistic) activation function that we remember from the section about logistic regression in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn: \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 1 1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 As you may recall, the sigmoid function is an S-shaped curve that maps the net input z onto a logistic distribution in the range 0 to 1, which cuts the y axis at z = 0, as shown in Figure 11.3: Figure 11.3: The sigmoid activation function", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 370, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The term feedforward refers to the fact that each layer serves as the input to the next layer without loops, in contrast to recurrent NNs\u2014an archi- tecture that we will discuss later in this chapter and discuss in more detail in Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks. The term multilayer perceptron may sound a little bit confusing since the artificial neurons in this network architecture are typically sigmoid units, not perceptrons. We can think of the neurons in the MLP as logistic regression units that return values in the continuous range between 0 and 1. For purposes of code efficiency and readability, we will now write the activation in a more compact form using the concepts of basic linear algebra, which will allow us to vectorize our code implementa- tion via NumPy rather than writing multiple nested and computationally expensive Python for loops: \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67(\u210e) = \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e(\u210e)\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47+ \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83(\u210e) \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e(\u210e) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)) Here, z (h) is our 1\u00d7m dimensional feature vector. W (h) is a d\u00d7m dimensional weight matrix where d is the number of units in the hidden layer; consequently, the transposed matrix W (h)T is m\u00d7d dimensional. The bias vector b (h) consists of d bias units (one bias unit per hidden node). After matrix-vector multiplication, we obtain the 1\u00d7d dimensional net input vector z (h) to calculate the activation a (h) (where \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc82(\u210e) \u2208\u211d1\u00d7\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51). Furthermore, we can generalize this computation to all n examples in the training dataset: Z (h) = X (in)W (h)T + b (h) Here, X (in) is now an n\u00d7m matrix, and the matrix multiplication will result in an n\u00d7d dimensional net input matrix, Z (h). Finally, we apply the activation function \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u22c5) to each value in the net input matrix to get the n\u00d7d activation matrix in the next layer (here, the output layer): \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68(\u210e) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)) Similarly, we can write the activation of the output layer in vectorized form for multiple examples: Z (out) = A (h)W (out)T + b (out) Here, we multiply the transpose of the t\u00d7d matrix W (out) (t is the number of output units) by the n\u00d7d dimensional matrix, A (h), and add the t dimensional bias vector b (out) to obtain the n\u00d7t dimensional matrix, Z (out).

The training dataset consists of handwritten digits from 250 different people, 50 percent high school students, and 50 percent employees from the Census Bureau. Note that the test dataset contains handwritten digits from different people following the same split. Instead of downloading the abovementioned dataset files and preprocessing them into NumPy arrays ourselves, we will use scikit-learn\u2019s new fetch_openml function, which allows us to load the MNIST dataset more conveniently: >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml >>> X, y = fetch_openml('mnist_784', version=1, ... return_X_y=True) >>> X = X.values >>> y = y.astype(int).values In scikit-learn, the fetch_openml function downloads the MNIST dataset from OpenML (https://www. openml.org/d/554) as pandas DataFrame and Series objects, which is why we use the .values attribute to obtain the underlying NumPy arrays. (If you are using a scikit-learn version older than 1.0, fetch_openml downloads NumPy arrays directly so you can omit using the .values attribute.) The n\u00d7m dimensional X array consists of 70,000 images with 784 pixels each, and the y array stores the corresponding 70,000 class labels, which we can confirm by checking the dimensions of the arrays as follows: >>> print(X.shape) (70000, 784) >>> print(y.shape) (70000,) The images in the MNIST dataset consist of 28\u00d728 pixels, and each pixel is represented by a grayscale intensity value. Here, fetch_openml already unrolled the 28\u00d728 pixels into one-dimensional row vectors, which represent the rows in our X array (784 per row or image) above. The second array (y) returned by the fetch_openml function contains the corresponding target variable, the class labels (integers 0-9) of the handwritten digits. Next, let\u2019s normalize the pixels values in MNIST to the range \u20131 to 1 (originally 0 to 255) via the fol- lowing code line: >>> X = ((X / 255.) - .5) * 2 The reason behind this is that gradient-based optimization is much more stable under these conditions, as discussed in Chapter 2. Note that we scaled the images on a pixel-by-pixel basis, which is different from the feature-scaling approach that we took in previous chapters. Previously, we derived scaling parameters from the training dataset and used these to scale each column in the training dataset and test dataset.

Similar to Adaline, these gradients are then used to update these parameters via gradient descent. Note that multilayer NNs are more complex than their single-layer siblings, and we will go over the mathematical concepts of how to compute the gradients in a later section after discussing the code. For now, just consider the backward method as a way for computing gradients that are used for the gradient descent updates. For simplic- ity, the loss function this derivation is based on is the same MSE loss that we used in Adaline. In later chapters, we will look at alternative loss functions, such as multi-category cross-entropy loss, which is a generalization of the binary logistic regression loss to multiple classes. Looking at this code implementation of the NeuralNetMLP class, you may have noticed that this object-oriented implementation differs from the familiar scikit-learn API that is centered around the .fit() and .predict() methods. Instead, the main methods of the NeuralNetMLP class are the .forward() and .backward() methods.

Second, we will embed these functions into the training loop that iterates over the dataset in multiple epochs. The first function we are going to define is a mini-batch generator, which takes in our dataset and divides it into mini-batches of a desired size for stochastic gradient descent training.

Remember that we have 10 output nodes (one corresponding to each unique class label). Hence, when computing the MSE, we first converted the class labels into one-hot encoded class labels in the mse_loss() function. In practice, it does not make a difference whether we average over the row or the columns of the squared-difference matrix first, so we simply call np.mean() without any axis specification so that it returns a scalar. The output layer activations, since we used the logistic sigmoid function, are values in the range [0, 1]. For each input, the output layer produces 10 values in the range [0, 1], so we used the np.argmax() function to select the index position of the largest value, which yields the predicted class label. We then compared the true labels with the predicted class labels to compute the accuracy via the accuracy() function we defined.

At approximately the 25th epoch, the training and validation accuracy values are almost equal, and then, the network starts to slightly overfit the training data. Finally, let\u2019s evaluate the generalization performance of the model by calculating the prediction ac- curacy on the test dataset: >>> test_mse, test_acc = compute_mse_and_acc(model, X_test, y_test) >>> print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc*100:.2f}%') Test accuracy: 94.51% We can see that the test accuracy is very close to the validation set accuracy corresponding to the last epoch (94.74%), which we reported during the training in the last subsection. Moreover, the respec- tive training accuracy is only minimally higher at 95.59%, reaffirming that our model only slightly overfits the training data.

If this sounds confusing, stay tuned for the next section, where we will discuss the dimensionality of W (h) and W (out) in more detail in the context of the backpropagation algorithm. Also, you are encouraged to read through the code of NeuralNetMLP again, which is annotated with helpful comments about the dimensionality of the different matrices and vector transformations. Developing your understanding of backpropagation Although backpropagation was introduced to the neural network community more than 30 years ago (Learning representations by backpropagating errors, by D.E. Rumelhart, G.E. Hinton, and R.J. Williams, Nature, 323: 6088, pages 533\u2013536, 1986), it remains one of the most widely used algorithms for training artificial NNs very efficiently. If you are interested in additional references regarding the history of backpropagation, Juergen Schmidhuber wrote a nice survey article, Who Invented Backpropagation?, which you can find online at http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation. html. This section will provide both a short, clear summary and the bigger picture of how this fascinat- ing algorithm works before we dive into more mathematical details. In essence, we can think of backpropagation as a very computationally efficient approach to compute the partial derivatives of a complex, non-convex loss function in multilayer NNs. Here, our goal is to use those derivatives to learn the weight coefficients for parameterizing such a multilayer artificial NN. The challenge in the parameterization of NNs is that we are typically dealing with a very large number of model param- eters in a high-dimensional feature space. In contrast to loss functions of single-layer NNs such as Adaline or logistic regression, which we have seen in previous chapters, the error surface of an NN loss function is not convex or smooth with respect to the parameters. There are many bumps in this high-dimensional loss surface (local minima) that we have to overcome in order to find the global minimum of the loss function. You may recall the concept of the chain rule from your introductory calculus classes. The chain rule is an approach to compute the derivative of a complex, nested function, such as f(g(x)), as follows: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51[\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65))] = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 Similarly, we can use the chain rule for an arbitrarily long function composition. For example, let\u2019s assume that we have five different functions, f(x), g(x), h(x), u(x), and v(x), and let F be the function composition: F(x) = f(g(h(u(v(x))))). Applying the chain rule, we can compute the derivative of this function as follows: \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51= \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54(\u210e(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65))))) = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\u22c5\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 391, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

If you are interested in learning more about automatic differentiation in machine learning applications, read A.G. Baydin and B.A. Pearlmutter\u2019s article, Automatic Differentiation of Algorithms for Machine Learning, arXiv preprint arXiv:1404.7456, 2014, which is freely available on arXiv at http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.7456.pdf. Automatic differentiation comes with two modes, the forward and reverse modes; backpropagation is simply a special case of reverse-mode automatic differentiation. The key point is that applying the chain rule in forward mode could be quite expensive since we would have to multiply large matrices for each layer (Jacobians) that we would eventually multiply by a vector to obtain the output. The trick of reverse mode is that we traverse the chain rule from right to left. We multiply a matrix by a vector, which yields another vector that is multiplied by the next matrix, and so on. Matrix-vector multiplication is computationally much cheaper than matrix-matrix multiplication, which is why backpropagation is one of the most popular algorithms used in NN training. Training neural networks via backpropagation In this section, we will go through the math of backpropagation to understand how you can learn the weights in an NN very efficiently. Depending on how comfortable you are with mathematical repre- sentations, the following equations may seem relatively complicated at first. In a previous section, we saw how to calculate the loss as the difference between the activation of the last layer and the target class label. Now, we will see how the backpropagation algorithm works to update the weights in our MLP model from a mathematical perspective, which we implemented in the .backward() method of the NeuralNetMLP() class. As we recall from the beginning of this chapter, we first need to apply forward propagation to obtain the activation of the output layer, which we formulated as follows: \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81(\u210e) = \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e(\u210e)\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47+ \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83(\u210e) (net input of the hidden layer) \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68(\u210e) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\u210e)) (activation of the hidden layer) \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c) = \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68(\u210e)\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c)\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47+ \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c) (net input of the output layer) \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c)) (activation of the output layer) A basic calculus refresher To fully understand backpropagation, we need to borrow certain concepts from differential calculus, which is outside the scope of this book. However, you can refer to a review chapter of the most fundamental concepts, which you might find useful in this context. It discusses function derivatives, partial derivatives, gradients, and the Jacobian. This text is freely accessible at https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/books/dlb/appendix_d_calculus. pdf.

We\u2019ll leave solving the individual parts as an optional exercise for you. About convergence in neural networks You might be wondering why we did not use regular gradient descent but instead used mini-batch learning to train our NN for the handwritten digit classification earlier. You may recall our discussion on SGD that we used to implement online learning. In online learning, we compute the gradient based on a single training example (k = 1) at a time to perform the weight update. Although this is a stochastic approach, it often leads to very accurate solutions with a much faster convergence than regular gra- dient descent. Mini-batch learning is a special form of SGD where we compute the gradient based on a subset k of the n training examples with 1 < k < n. Mini-batch learning has an advantage over online learning in that we can make use of our vectorized implementations to improve computational effi- ciency. However, we can update the weights much faster than in regular gradient descent. Intuitively, you can think of mini-batch learning as predicting the voter turnout of a presidential election from a poll by asking only a representative subset of the population rather than asking the entire population (which would be equal to running the actual election). Multilayer NNs are much harder to train than simpler algorithms such as Adaline, logistic regres- sion, or support vector machines. In multilayer NNs, we typically have hundreds, thousands, or even billions of weights that we need to optimize. Unfortunately, the output function has a rough surface, and the optimization algorithm can easily become trapped in local minima, as shown in Figure 11.14: Figure 11.14: Optimization algorithms can become trapped in local minima Note that this representation is extremely simplified since our NN has many dimensions; it makes it impossible to visualize the actual loss surface for the human eye. Here, we only show the loss surface for a single weight on the x axis. However, the main message is that we do not want our algorithm to get trapped in local minima. By increasing the learning rate, we can more readily escape such local minima. On the other hand, we also increase the chance of overshooting the global optimum if the learning rate is too large. Since we initialize the weights randomly, we start with a solution to the optimization problem that is typically hopelessly wrong.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 396, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In fact, we will introduce more complex NN models in the next chapters, which we will train using the open source PyTorch library (https://pytorch.org). Although the from-scratch implementation in this chapter seems a bit tedious at first, it was a good exercise for understanding the basics behind backpropagation and NN training. A basic understand- ing of algorithms is crucial for applying machine learning techniques appropriately and successfully. Now that you have learned how feedforward NNs work, we are ready to explore more sophisticated DNNs using PyTorch, which allows us to construct NNs more efficiently, as we will see in Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch. PyTorch, which was originally released in September 2016, has gained a lot of popularity among ma- chine learning researchers, who use it to construct DNNs because of its ability to optimize mathematical expressions for computations on multidimensional arrays utilizing graphics processing units (GPUs). Lastly, we should note that scikit-learn also includes a basic MLP implementation, MLPClassifier, which you can find at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_ network.MLPClassifier.html. While this implementation is great and very convenient for training basic MLPs, we strongly recommend specialized deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch, for imple- menting and training multilayer NNs. Summary In this chapter, you have learned the basic concepts behind multilayer artificial NNs, which are cur- rently the hottest topic in machine learning research. In Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, we started our journey with simple single-layer NN structures and now we have connected multiple neurons to a powerful NN architecture to solve complex problems such as handwritten digit recognition. We demystified the popular backpropagation algorithm, which is one of the building blocks of many NN models that are used in deep learning. After learning about the backpropagation algorithm in this chapter, we are well equipped for exploring more complex DNN architectures. In the remaining chapters, we will cover more advanced deep learning concepts and PyTorch, an open source library that allows us to implement and train multilayer NNs more efficiently.

In this chapter, we will start using PyTorch and see how it brings significant benefits to training performance.

Then, we will take a high-level look at what PyTorch is and what our learning approach will be in this chapter. Performance challenges The performance of computer processors has, of course, been continuously improving in recent years. That allows us to train more powerful and complex learning systems, which means that we can improve the predictive performance of our machine learning models.

However, by default, Python is limited to execution on one core due to the global interpreter lock (GIL). So, although we indeed take advantage of Python\u2019s mul- tiprocessing library to distribute our computations over multiple cores, we still have to consider that the most advanced desktop hardware rarely comes with more than 8 or 16 such cores. You will recall from Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch, that we implemented a very simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) with only one hidden layer consisting of 100 units. We had to optimize approximately 80,000 weight parameters ([784*100 + 100] + [100 * 10] + 10 = 79,510) for a very simple image classification task. The images in MNIST are rather small (28\u00d728), and we can only imagine the explosion in the number of parameters if we wanted to add additional hidden layers or work with images that have higher pixel densities. Such a task would quickly become unfeasible for a single processing unit. The question then becomes, how can we tackle such problems more effectively? The obvious solution to this problem is to use graphics processing units (GPUs), which are real work- horses. You can think of a graphics card as a small computer cluster inside your machine. Another advantage is that modern GPUs are great value compared to the state-of-the-art central processing units (CPUs), as you can see in the following overview: Figure 12.1: Comparison of a state-of-the-art CPU and GPU The sources for the information in Figure 12.1 are the following websites (date accessed: July 2021): \u2022 https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/215570/intel-core-i9- 11900kb-processor-24m-cache-up-to-4-90-ghz.html \u2022 https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080-3080ti/ At 2.2 times the price of a modern CPU, we can get a GPU that has 640 times more cores and is capa- ble of around 46 times more floating-point calculations per second. So, what is holding us back from utilizing GPUs for our machine learning tasks? The challenge is that writing code to target GPUs is not as simple as executing Python code in our interpreter. There are special packages, such as CUDA and OpenCL, that allow us to target the GPU. However, writing code in CUDA or OpenCL is probably not the most convenient way to implement and run machine learning algorithms.

PyTorch is a scalable and multiplatform programming interface for implementing and running ma- chine learning algorithms, including convenience wrappers for deep learning. PyTorch was primarily developed by the researchers and engineers from the Facebook AI Research (FAIR) lab. Its development also involves many contributions from the community. PyTorch was initially released in September 2016 and is free and open source under the modified BSD license. Many machine learning research- ers and practitioners from academia and industry have adapted PyTorch to develop deep learning solutions, such as Tesla Autopilot, Uber\u2019s Pyro, and Hugging Face\u2019s Transformers (https://pytorch. org/ecosystem/). To improve the performance of training machine learning models, PyTorch allows execution on CPUs, GPUs, and XLA devices such as TPUs. However, its greatest performance capabilities can be discov- ered when using GPUs and XLA devices. PyTorch supports CUDA-enabled and ROCm GPUs officially. PyTorch\u2019s development is based on the Torch library (www.torch.ch). As its name implies, the Python interface is the primary development focus of PyTorch. PyTorch is built around a computation graph composed of a set of nodes. Each node represents an operation that may have zero or more inputs or outputs. PyTorch provides an imperative program- ming environment that evaluates operations, executes computation, and returns concrete values immediately. Hence, the computation graph in PyTorch is defined implicitly, rather than constructed in advance and executed after. Mathematically, tensors can be understood as a generalization of scalars, vectors, matrices, and so on. More concretely, a scalar can be defined as a rank-0 tensor, a vector can be defined as a rank-1 tensor, a matrix can be defined as a rank-2 tensor, and matrices stacked in a third dimension can be defined as rank-3 tensors. Tensors in PyTorch are similar to NumPy\u2019s arrays, except that tensors are optimized for automatic differentiation and can run on GPUs. To make the concept of a tensor clearer, consider Figure 12.2, which represents tensors of ranks 0 and 1 in the first row, and tensors of ranks 2 and 3 in the second row: Figure 12.2: Different types of tensor in PyTorch Now that we know what PyTorch is, let\u2019s see how to use it.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 400, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In addition, we will discuss the existing, ready-to-use datasets in the torch.utils.data.Dataset submodule and learn how to use them. After learning about these basics, the PyTorch neural network torch.nn module will be introduced. Then, we will move forward to building machine learning models, learn how to compose and train the models, and learn how to save the trained models on disk for future evaluation. First steps with PyTorch In this section, we will take our first steps in using the low-level PyTorch API. After installing PyTorch, we will cover how to create tensors in PyTorch and different ways of manipulating them, such as changing their shape, data type, and so on. Installing PyTorch To install PyTorch, we recommend consulting the latest instructions on the official https://pytorch.org website. Below, we will outline the basic steps that will work on most systems. Depending on how your system is set up, you can typically just use Python\u2019s pip installer and install PyTorch from PyPI by executing the following from your terminal: pip install torch torchvision This will install the latest stable version, which is 1.9.0 at the time of writing. To install the 1.9.0 ver- sion, which is guaranteed to be compatible with the following code examples, you can modify the preceding command as follows: pip install torch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.0 If you want to use GPUs (recommended), you need a compatible NVIDIA graphics card that supports CUDA and cuDNN. If your machine satisfies these requirements, you can install PyTorch with GPU support, as follows: pip install torch==1.9.0+cu111 torchvision==0.10.0+cu111 -f https://download. pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html for CUDA 11.1 or: pip install torch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.0\\ -f https://download.pytorch.org/ whl/torch_stable.html for CUDA 10.2 as of the time of writing. As macOS binaries don\u2019t support CUDA, you can install from source: https://pytorch.org/get- started/locally/#mac-from-source.

Firstly, we can simply create a tensor from a list or a NumPy array using the torch.tensor or the torch.from_numpy function as follows: >>> import torch >>> import numpy as np >>> np.set_printoptions(precision=3) >>> a = [1, 2, 3] >>> b = np.array([4, 5, 6], dtype=np.int32) >>> t_a = torch.tensor(a) >>> t_b = torch.from_numpy(b) >>> print(t_a) >>> print(t_b) tensor([1, 2, 3]) tensor([4, 5, 6], dtype=torch.int32) This resulted in tensors t_a and t_b, with their properties, shape=(3,) and dtype=int32, adopted from their source. Similar to NumPy arrays, we can also see these properties: >>> t_ones = torch.ones(2, 3) >>> t_ones.shape torch.Size([2, 3]) >>> print(t_ones) Troubleshooting your installation of PyTorch If you experience problems with the installation procedure, read more about system- and platform-specific recommendations that are provided at https://pytorch.org/ get-started/locally/. Note that all the code in this chapter can be run on your CPU; using a GPU is entirely optional but recommended if you want to fully enjoy the benefits of PyTorch. For example, while training some NN models on a CPU could take a week, the same models could be trained in just a few hours on a modern GPU. If you have a graphics card, refer to the installation page to set it up appropriately. In addition, you may find this setup guide helpful, which explains how to install the NVIDIA graphics card drivers, CUDA, and cuDNN on Ubuntu (not required but recommended requirements for running PyTorch on a GPU): https://sebastianraschka.com/pdf/books/dlb/ appendix_h_cloud-computing.pdf.

In this section, you will learn how to manipulate tensor data types and shapes via several PyTorch functions that cast, reshape, transpose, and squeeze (remove dimensions). The torch.to() function can be used to change the data type of a tensor to a desired type: >>> t_a_new = t_a.to(torch.int64) >>> print(t_a_new.dtype) torch.int64 See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_attributes.html for all other data types. As you will see in upcoming chapters, certain operations require that the input tensors have a certain number of dimensions (that is, rank) associated with a certain number of elements (shape). Thus, we might need to change the shape of a tensor, add a new dimension, or squeeze an unnecessary dimen- sion. PyTorch provides useful functions (or operations) to achieve this, such as torch.transpose(), torch.reshape(), and torch.squeeze(). Let\u2019s take a look at some examples: \u2022 Transposing a tensor: >>> t = torch.rand(3, 5) >>> t_tr = torch.transpose(t, 0, 1) >>> print(t.shape, ' --> ', t_tr.shape) torch.Size([3, 5]) --> torch.Size([5, 3]) \u2022 Reshaping a tensor (for example, from a 1D vector to a 2D array): >>> t = torch.zeros(30) >>> t_reshape = t.reshape(5, 6) >>> print(t_reshape.shape) torch.Size([5, 6]) \u2022 Removing the unnecessary dimensions (dimensions that have size 1, which are not needed): >>> t = torch.zeros(1, 2, 1, 4, 1) >>> t_sqz = torch.squeeze(t, 2) >>> print(t.shape, ' --> ', t_sqz.shape) torch.Size([1, 2, 1, 4, 1]) --> torch.Size([1, 2, 4, 1])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 403, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In this subsection, we will cover some widely used linear algebra operations, such as element-wise product, matrix multiplication, and computing the norm of a tensor. First, let\u2019s instantiate two random tensors, one with uniform distribution in the range [\u20131, 1) and the other with a standard normal distribution: >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> t1 = 2 * torch.rand(5, 2) - 1 >>> t2 = torch.normal(mean=0, std=1, size=(5, 2)) Note that torch.rand returns a tensor filled with random numbers from a uniform distribution in the range of [0, 1). Notice that t1 and t2 have the same shape. Now, to compute the element-wise product of t1 and t2, we can use the following: >>> t3 = torch.multiply(t1, t2) >>> print(t3) tensor([[ 0.4426, -0.3114], [ 0.0660, -0.5970], [ 1.1249, 0.0150], [ 0.1569, 0.7107], [-0.0451, -0.0352]]) To compute the mean, sum, and standard deviation along a certain axis (or axes), we can use torch. mean(), torch.sum(), and torch.std(). For example, the mean of each column in t1 can be com- puted as follows: >>> t4 = torch.mean(t1, axis=0) >>> print(t4) tensor([-0.1373, 0.2028]) The matrix-matrix product between t1 and t2 (that is, \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc611 \u00d7 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc612 T, where the superscript T is for transpose) can be computed by using the torch.matmul() function as follows: >>> t5 = torch.matmul(t1, torch.transpose(t2, 0, 1)) >>> print(t5) tensor([[ 0.1312, 0.3860, -0.6267, -1.0096, -0.2943], [ 0.1647, -0.5310, 0.2434, 0.8035, 0.1980], [-0.3855, -0.4422, 1.1399, 1.5558, 0.4781], [ 0.1822, -0.5771, 0.2585, 0.8676, 0.2132], [ 0.0330, 0.1084, -0.1692, -0.2771, -0.0804]])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 404, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For ex- ample, we can calculate the L 2 norm of t1 as follows: >>> norm_t1 = torch.linalg.norm(t1, ord=2, dim=1) >>> print(norm_t1) tensor([0.6785, 0.5078, 1.1162, 0.5488, 0.1853]) To verify that this code snippet computes the L 2 norm of t1 correctly, you can compare the results with the following NumPy function: np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(t1.numpy()), axis=1)). Split, stack, and concatenate tensors In this subsection, we will cover PyTorch operations for splitting a tensor into multiple tensors, or the reverse: stacking and concatenating multiple tensors into a single one. Assume that we have a single tensor, and we want to split it into two or more tensors. For this, PyTorch provides a convenient torch.chunk() function, which divides an input tensor into a list of equally sized tensors. We can determine the desired number of splits as an integer using the chunks argument to split a tensor along the desired dimension specified by the dim argument. In this case, the total size of the input tensor along the specified dimension must be divisible by the desired number of splits. Alternatively, we can provide the desired sizes in a list using the torch.split() function. Let\u2019s have a look at an example of both these options: \u2022 Providing the number of splits: >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> t = torch.rand(6) >>> print(t) tensor([0.7576, 0.2793, 0.4031, 0.7347, 0.0293, 0.7999]) >>> t_splits = torch.chunk(t, 3) >>> [item.numpy() for item in t_splits] [array([0.758, 0.279], dtype=float32), array([0.403, 0.735], dtype=float32), array([0.029, 0.8 ], dtype=float32)] In this example, a tensor of size 6 was divided into a list of three tensors each with size 2.

In this case, PyTorch functions such as torch.stack() and torch.cat() come in handy. For example, let\u2019s create a 1D tensor, A, containing 1s with size 3, and a 1D tensor, B, containing 0s with size 2, and concatenate them into a 1D tensor, C, of size 5: >>> A = torch.ones(3) >>> B = torch.zeros(2) >>> C = torch.cat([A, B], axis=0) >>> print(C) tensor([1., 1., 1., 0., 0.]) If we create 1D tensors A and B, both with size 3, then we can stack them together to form a 2D tensor, S: >>> A = torch.ones(3) >>> B = torch.zeros(3) >>> S = torch.stack([A, B], axis=1) >>> print(S) tensor([[1., 0.], [1., 0.], [1., 0.]]) The PyTorch API has many operations that you can use for building a model, processing your data, and more.

In cas- es where the training dataset is rather small and can be loaded as a tensor into the memory, we can directly use this tensor for training.

In addition, we may need to construct a data-processing pipeline to apply certain transformations and preprocessing steps to our data, such as mean centering, scaling, or adding noise to augment the training procedure and to prevent overfitting. Applying preprocessing functions manually every time can be quite cumbersome. Luckily, PyTorch provides a special class for constructing efficient and convenient preprocessing pipelines. In this sec- tion, we will see an overview of different methods for constructing a PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader, and implementing data loading, shuffling, and batching. Creating a PyTorch DataLoader from existing tensors If the data already exists in the form of a tensor object, a Python list, or a NumPy array, we can easily create a dataset loader using the torch.utils.data.DataLoader() class. It returns an object of the DataLoader class, which we can use to iterate through the individual elements in the input dataset. As a simple example, consider the following code, which creates a dataset from a list of values from 0 to 5: >>> from torch.utils.data import DataLoader >>> t = torch.arange(6, dtype=torch.float32) >>> data_loader = DataLoader(t) We can easily iterate through a dataset entry by entry as follows: >>> for item in data_loader: ... print(item) tensor([0.]) tensor([1.]) tensor([2.]) tensor([3.]) tensor([4.]) tensor([5.])", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 407, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The optional drop_last argument is useful for cases when the number of elements in the tensor is not divisible by the desired batch size. We can drop the last non-full batch by setting drop_last to True. The default value for drop_last is False. We can always iterate through a dataset directly, but as you just saw, DataLoader provides an automatic and customizable batching to a dataset. Combining two tensors into a joint dataset Often, we may have the data in two (or possibly more) tensors. For example, we could have a tensor for features and a tensor for labels. In such cases, we need to build a dataset that combines these tensors, which will allow us to retrieve the elements of these tensors in tuples. Assume that we have two tensors, t_x and t_y. Tensor t_x holds our feature values, each of size 3, and t_y stores the class labels. For this example, we first create these two tensors as follows: >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> t_x = torch.rand([4, 3], dtype=torch.float32) >>> t_y = torch.arange(4) Now, we want to create a joint dataset from these two tensors. We first need to create a Dataset class as follows: >>> from torch.utils.data import Dataset >>> class JointDataset(Dataset): ... def __init__(self, x, y): ... self.x = x ... self.y = y ... ... def __len__(self): ... return len(self.x) ...", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 408, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Then we create a joint dataset of t_x and t_y with the custom Dataset class as follows: >>> joint_dataset = JointDataset(t_x, t_y) Finally, we can print each example of the joint dataset as follows: >>> for example in joint_dataset: ... print(' x: ', example[0], ' y: ', example[1]) x: tensor([0.7576, 0.2793, 0.4031]) y: tensor(0) x: tensor([0.7347, 0.0293, 0.7999]) y: tensor(1) x: tensor([0.3971, 0.7544, 0.5695]) y: tensor(2) x: tensor([0.4388, 0.6387, 0.5247]) y: tensor(3) We can also simply utilize the torch.utils.data.TensorDataset class, if the second dataset is a labeled dataset in the form of tensors. So, instead of using our self-defined Dataset class, JointDataset, we can create a joint dataset as follows: >>> joint_dataset = JointDataset(t_x, t_y) Note that a common source of error could be that the element-wise correspondence between the orig- inal features (x) and labels (y) might be lost (for example, if the two datasets are shuffled separately). However, once they are merged into one dataset, it is safe to apply these operations. If we have a dataset created from the list of image filenames on disk, we can define a function to load the images from these filenames. You will see an example of applying multiple transformations to a dataset later in this chapter. Shuffle, batch, and repeat As was mentioned in Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification, when training an NN model using stochastic gradient descent optimization, it is important to feed training data as randomly shuffled batches. You have already seen how to specify the batch size using the batch_size argument of a data loader object. Now, in addition to creating batches, you will see how to shuffle and reiterate over the datasets. We will continue working with the previous joint dataset.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 409, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Now we iterate through the data loader entry by entry as follows: >>> for i, batch in enumerate(data_loader, 1): ... print(f'batch {i}:', 'x:', batch[0], '\\n y:', batch[1]) batch 1: x: tensor([[0.4388, 0.6387, 0.5247], [0.3971, 0.7544, 0.5695]]) y: tensor([3, 2]) batch 2: x: tensor([[0.7576, 0.2793, 0.4031], [0.7347, 0.0293, 0.7999]]) y: tensor([0, 1]) The rows are shuffled without losing the one-to-one correspondence between the entries in x and y.

In the second epoch, two batches contain a pair of values, [y=2, y=0] and [y=1, y=3] respectively. For each iteration, the elements within a batch are also shuffled. Creating a dataset from files on your local storage disk In this section, we will build a dataset from image files stored on disk. There is an image folder asso- ciated with the online content of this chapter. After downloading the folder, you should be able to see six images of cats and dogs in JPEG format. This small dataset will show how building a dataset from stored files generally works. To accomplish this, we are going to use two additional modules: Image in PIL to read the image file contents and transforms in torchvision to decode the raw contents and resize the images. Before we start, let\u2019s take a look at the content of these files. We will use the pathlib library to gen- erate a list of image files: >>> import pathlib >>> imgdir_path = pathlib.Path('cat_dog_images') >>> file_list = sorted([str(path) for path in ... imgdir_path.glob('*.jpg')]) >>> print(file_list) ['cat_dog_images/dog-03.jpg', 'cat_dog_images/cat-01.jpg', 'cat_dog_images/cat- 02.jpg', 'cat_dog_images/cat-03.jpg', 'cat_dog_images/dog-01.jpg', 'cat_dog_ images/dog-02.jpg'] Next, we will visualize these image examples using Matplotlib: >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> import os >>> from PIL import Image >>> fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5)) >>> for i, file in enumerate(file_list): ... img = Image.open(file) ... print('Image shape:', np.array(img).shape) ... ax = fig.add_subplot(2, 3, i+1) ... ax.set_xticks([]); ax.set_yticks([]) The PIL.Image and torchvision.transforms modules provide a lot of additional and useful functions, which are beyond the scope of the book.

If you print the aspect ratios (or data array shapes) of these images, you will see that some images are 900 pixels high and 1200 pixels wide (900\u00d71200), some are 800\u00d71200, and one is 900\u00d7742. Later, we will preprocess these images to a consistent size. Another point to consider is that the labels for these images are provided within their filenames. So, we extract these labels from the list of filenames, assigning label 1 to dogs and label 0 to cats: >>> labels = [1 if 'dog' in ... os.path.basename(file) else 0 ... for file in file_list] >>> print(labels) [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1] Now, we have two lists: a list of filenames (or paths of each image) and a list of their labels.

Next, we need to apply transformations to this dataset: load the image content from its file path, de- code the raw content, and resize it to a desired size, for example, 80\u00d7120. As mentioned before, we use the torchvision.transforms module to resize the images and convert the loaded pixels into tensors as follows: >>> import torchvision.transforms as transforms >>> img_height, img_width = 80, 120 >>> transform = transforms.Compose([ ... transforms.ToTensor(), ... transforms.Resize((img_height, img_width)), ... ]) Now we update the ImageDataset class with the transform we just defined: >>> class ImageDataset(Dataset): ... def __init__(self, file_list, labels, transform=None): ... self.file_list = file_list ... self.labels = labels ... self.transform = transform ...", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 413, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Fetching available datasets from the torchvision.datasets library The torchvision.datasets library provides a nice collection of freely available image datasets for training or evaluating deep learning models. Similarly, the torchtext.datasets library provides datasets for natural language. Here, we use torchvision.datasets as an example. The torchvision datasets (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html) are nicely format- ted and come with informative descriptions, including the format of features and labels and their type and dimensionality, as well as the link to the original source of the dataset. Another advantage is that these datasets are all subclasses of torch.utils.data.Dataset, so all the functions we covered in the previous sections can be used directly. So, let\u2019s see how to use these datasets in action. First, if you haven\u2019t already installed torchvision together with PyTorch earlier, you need to install the torchvision library via pip from the command line: pip install torchvision You can take a look at the list of available datasets at https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets. html. In the following paragraphs, we will cover fetching two different datasets: CelebA (celeb_a) and the MNIST digit dataset. Let\u2019s first work with the CelebA dataset (http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) with torchvision.datasets.CelebA (https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html#celeba). The description of torchvision.datasets.CelebA provides some useful information to help us understand the structure of this dataset: \u2022 The database has three subsets, 'train', 'valid', and 'test'. We can select a specific subset or load all of them with the split parameter. \u2022 The images are stored in PIL.Image format. And we can obtain a transformed version using a custom transform function, such as transforms.ToTensor and transforms.Resize. \u2022 There are different types of targets we can use, including 'attributes', 'identity', and 'landmarks'. 'attributes' is 40 facial attributes for the person in the image, such as facial expression, makeup, hair properties, and so on; 'identity' is the person ID for an image; and 'landmarks' refers to the dictionary of extracted facial points, such as the position of the eyes, nose, and so on.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 415, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

This is a limitation of Google Drive and can only be overcome by trying again later; it just means that Google Drive has a daily maximum quota that is exceeded by the CelebA files. To work around it, you can manually download the files from the source: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/ CelebA.html. In the downloaded folder, celeba/, you can unzip the img_align_celeba.zip file. The image_path is the root of the downloaded folder, celeba/. If you have already downloaded the files once, you can simply set download=False. For additional information and guidance, we highly recom- mend to see accompanying code notebook at https://github.com/rasbt/machine-learning-book/ blob/main/ch12/ch12_part1.ipynb.

Building an NN model in PyTorch So far in this chapter, you have learned about the basic utility components of PyTorch for manipulat- ing tensors and organizing data into formats that we can iterate over during training. In this section, we will finally implement our first predictive model in PyTorch. As PyTorch is a bit more flexible but also more complex than machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, we will start with a simple linear regression model.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 418, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

It allows easy pro- totyping and the building of complex models in just a few lines of code. To fully utilize the power of the module and customize it for your problem, you need to understand what it\u2019s doing. To develop this understanding, we will first train a basic linear regression model on a toy dataset without using any features from the torch.nn module; we will use nothing but the basic PyTorch tensor operations. Then, we will incrementally add features from torch.nn and torch.optim. As you will see in the following subsections, these modules make building an NN model extremely easy. We will also take advantage of the dataset pipeline functionalities supported in PyTorch, such as Dataset and DataLoader, which you learned about in the previous section. In this book, we will use the torch.nn module to build NN models. The most commonly used approach for building an NN in PyTorch is through nn.Module, which allows layers to be stacked to form a network. This gives us more control over the forward pass. We will see examples of building an NN model using the nn.Module class. Finally, as you will see in the following subsections, a trained model can be saved and reloaded for future use. Building a linear regression model In this subsection, we will build a simple model to solve a linear regression problem. First, let\u2019s create a toy dataset in NumPy and visualize it: >>> X_train = np.arange(10, dtype='float32').reshape((10, 1)) >>> y_train = np.array([1.0, 1.3, 3.1, 2.0, 5.0, ... 6.3, 6.6,7.4, 8.0, ... 9.0], dtype='float32') >>> plt.plot(X_train, y_train, 'o', markersize=10) >>> plt.xlabel('x') >>> plt.ylabel('y') >>> plt.show()", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 419, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Here, we will choose the mean squared error (MSE) as our loss function: >>> def loss_fn(input, target): ... return (input-target).pow(2).mean() Furthermore, to learn the weight parameters of the model, we will use stochastic gradient descent. In this subsection, we will implement this training via the stochastic gradient descent procedure by ourselves, but in the next subsection, we will use the SGD method from the optimization package, torch.optim, to do the same thing. To implement the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we need to compute the gradients. Rather than manually computing the gradients, we will use PyTorch\u2019s torch.autograd.backward function.

We trained this model using stochastic gradient descent optimization. While we started our journey based on the simplest possible example, you can see that defining the model from scratch, even for such a simple case, is neither appealing nor good practice. PyTorch instead provides already defined layers through torch.nn that can be readily used as the building blocks of an NN model. In this section, you will learn how to use these layers to solve a classification task using the Iris flower dataset (identifying between three spe- cies of irises) and build a two-layer perceptron using the torch.nn module.

X, y, test_size=1./3, random_state=1) Here, we randomly select 100 samples (2/3) for training and 50 samples (1/3) for testing. Next, we standardize the features (mean centering and dividing by the standard deviation) and create a PyTorch Dataset for the training set and a corresponding DataLoader: >>> X_train_norm = (X_train - np.mean(X_train)) / np.std(X_train) >>> X_train_norm = torch.from_numpy(X_train_norm).float() >>> y_train = torch.from_numpy(y_train) >>> train_ds = TensorDataset(X_train_norm, y_train) >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> batch_size = 2 >>> train_dl = DataLoader(train_ds, batch_size, shuffle=True) Here, we set the batch size to 2 for the DataLoader. Now, we are ready to use the torch.nn module to build a model efficiently. In particular, using the nn.Module class, we can stack a few layers and build an NN. You can see the list of all the layers that are already available at https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html. For this problem, we are going to use the Linear layer, which is also known as a fully connected layer or dense layer, and can be best represented by f(w \u00d7 x + b), where x represents a tensor containing the input features, w and b are the weight matrix and the bias vector, and f is the activation function. Each layer in an NN receives its inputs from the preceding layer; therefore, its dimensionality (rank and shape) is fixed. Typically, we need to concern ourselves with the dimensionality of output only when we design an NN architecture. Here, we want to define a model with two hidden layers. The first one receives an input of four features and projects them to 16 neurons. The second layer receives the output of the previous layer (which has a size of 16) and projects them to three output neurons, since we have three class labels. This can be done as follows: >>> class Model(nn.Module): ... def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size): ... super().__init__() ... self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size) ... self.layer2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size) ... def forward(self, x): ... x = self.layer1(x) ... x = nn.Sigmoid()(x) ... x = self.layer2(x) ... x = nn.Softmax(dim=1)(x) ... return x", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 425, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Softmax activation in the last layer is used to support multiclass classification since we have three class labels here (which is why we have three neurons in the output layer). We will discuss the different activation functions and their applications later in this chapter. Next, we specify the loss function as cross-entropy loss and the optimizer as Adam: >>> learning_rate = 0.001 >>> loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() >>> optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate) Now, we can train the model. We will specify the number of epochs to be 100. The code of training the flower classification model is as follows: >>> num_epochs = 100 >>> loss_hist = [0] * num_epochs >>> accuracy_hist = [0] * num_epochs >>> for epoch in range(num_epochs): ... for x_batch, y_batch in train_dl: ... pred = model(x_batch) ... loss = loss_fn(pred, y_batch) ... loss.backward() ... optimizer.step() ... optimizer.zero_grad() ... loss_hist[epoch] += loss.item()*y_batch.size(0) ... is_correct = (torch.argmax(pred, dim=1) == y_batch).float() ... accuracy_hist[epoch] += is_correct.mean() ... loss_hist[epoch] /= len(train_dl.dataset) ... accuracy_hist[epoch] /= len(train_dl.dataset) The loss_hist and accuracy_hist lists keep the training loss and the training accuracy after each epoch.

Note that in this book, the sigmoidal logistic function, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 1 1+\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 , is referred to as the sigmoid function for brevity, which is common in machine learning literature. In the following subsections, you will learn more about alternative nonlinear functions that are useful for implementing multilayer NNs. Technically, we can use any function as an activation function in multilayer NNs as long as it is differ- entiable. We can even use linear activation functions, such as in Adaline (Chapter 2, Training Simple Machine Learning Algorithms for Classification). However, in practice, it would not be very useful to use linear activation functions for both hidden and output layers, since we want to introduce nonlinearity in a typical artificial NN to be able to tackle complex problems. The sum of linear functions yields a linear function after all. The logistic (sigmoid) activation function that we used in Chapter 11 probably mimics the concept of a neuron in a brain most closely\u2014we can think of it as the probability of whether a neuron fires. However, the logistic (sigmoid) activation function can be problematic if we have highly negative input, since the output of the sigmoid function will be close to zero in this case. If the sigmoid function returns output that is close to zero, the NN will learn very slowly, and it will be more likely to get trapped in the local minima of the loss landscape during training. This is why people often prefer a hyperbolic tangent as an activation function in hidden layers. Before we discuss what a hyperbolic tangent looks like, let\u2019s briefly recapitulate some of the basics of the logistic function and look at a generalization that makes it more useful for multilabel classification problems. Logistic function recap As was mentioned in the introduction to this section, the logistic function is, in fact, a special case of a sigmoid function. You will recall from the section on logistic regression in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, that we can use a logistic function to model the probability that sample x belongs to the positive class (class 1) in a binary classification task. The given net input, z, is shown in the following equation: \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc670\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc650 + \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc641\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 + \u22ef+ \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a= \u2211\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64T\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65 The logistic (sigmoid) function will compute the following: \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0elogistic(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 1 1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 429, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In Chapter 11, we used the one-hot encoding technique to represent multiclass ground truth labels and designed the output layer consisting of multiple logistic activation units.

One way to predict the class label from the output units obtained earlier is to use the maximum value: >>> y_class = np.argmax(Z, axis=0) >>> print('Predicted class label:', y_class) Predicted class label: 0 In certain contexts, it can be useful to compute meaningful class probabilities for multiclass predic- tions.

Estimating class probabilities in multiclass classification via the softmax function In the previous section, you saw how we can obtain a class label using the argmax function. Previously, in the Building a multilayer perceptron for classifying flowers in the Iris dataset section, we determined activation='softmax' in the last layer of the MLP model. The softmax function is a soft form of the argmax function; instead of giving a single class index, it provides the probability of each class. Therefore, it allows us to compute meaningful class probabilities in multiclass settings (multinomial logistic regression). In softmax, the probability of a particular sample with net input z belonging to the ith class can be computed with a normalization term in the denominator, that is, the sum of the exponentially weighted linear functions: \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2211 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 To see softmax in action, let\u2019s code it up in Python: >>> def softmax(z): ... return np.exp(z) / np.sum(np.exp(z)) >>> y_probas = softmax(Z) >>> print('Probabilities:\\n', y_probas) Probabilities: [ 0.44668973 0.16107406 0.39223621] >>> np.sum(y_probas) 1.0 As you can see, the predicted class probabilities now sum to 1, as we would expect. It is also notable that the predicted class label is the same as when we applied the argmax function to the logistic output.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 431, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Therefore, when we build a multiclass classification model in PyTorch, we can use the torch.softmax() function to estimate the probabilities of each class membership for an input batch of examples. To see how we can use the torch.softmax() activation function in PyTorch, we will convert Z to a tensor in the following code, with an additional dimension reserved for the batch size: >>> torch.softmax(torch.from_numpy(Z), dim=0) tensor([0.4467, 0.1611, 0.3922], dtype=torch.float64) Broadening the output spectrum using a hyperbolic tangent Another sigmoidal function that is often used in the hidden layers of artificial NNs is the hyperbolic tangent (commonly known as tanh), which can be interpreted as a rescaled version of the logistic function: \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0elogistic(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 1 1 + \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0etanh(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = 2 \u00d7 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0elogistic(2\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) \u22121 = \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\u2212\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67+ \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67 The advantage of the hyperbolic tangent over the logistic function is that it has a broader output spectrum ranging in the open interval (\u20131, 1), which can improve the convergence of the backpropa- gation algorithm (Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition, C. M. Bishop, Oxford University Press, pages: 500-501, 1995). In contrast, the logistic function returns an output signal ranging in the open interval (0, 1). For a simple comparison of the logistic function and the hyperbolic tangent, let\u2019s plot the two sigmoidal functions: >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> def tanh(z): ... e_p = np.exp(z) ... e_m = np.exp(-z) ... return (e_p - e_m) / (e_p + e_m) >>> z = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.005) >>> log_act = logistic(z) >>> tanh_act = tanh(z) >>> plt.ylim([-1.5, 1.5]) >>> plt.xlabel('net input $z$') >>> plt.ylabel('activation $\\phi(z)$') >>> plt.axhline(1, color='black', linestyle=':') >>> plt.axhline(0.5, color='black', linestyle=':') >>> plt.axhline(0, color='black', linestyle=':')", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 432, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In practice, we can use NumPy\u2019s tanh function.

Before we delve into ReLU, we should step back and understand the vanishing gradient problem of tanh and logistic activations. To understand this problem, let\u2019s assume that we initially have the net input z1 = 20, which changes to z2 = 25. Computing the tanh activation, we get \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc671) = 1.0 and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc672) = 1.0, which shows no change in the output (due to the asymptotic behavior of the tanh function and numerical errors). This means that the derivative of activations with respect to the net input diminishes as z becomes large. As a result, learning the weights during the training phase becomes very slow because the gra- dient terms may be very close to zero. ReLU activation addresses this issue. Mathematically, ReLU is defined as follows: \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = max(0, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) ReLU is still a nonlinear function that is good for learning complex functions with NNs. Besides this, the derivative of ReLU, with respect to its input, is always 1 for positive input values. Therefore, it solves the problem of vanishing gradients, making it suitable for deep NNs. In PyTorch, we can apply the ReLU activation torch.relu() as follows: >>> torch.relu(torch.from_numpy(z)) tensor([0.0000, 0.0000, 0.0000, ..., 4.9850, 4.9900, 4.9950], dtype=torch.float64) We will use the ReLU activation function in the next chapter as an activation function for multilayer convolutional NNs. Note that using torch.sigmoid(x) produces results that are equivalent to torch. nn.Sigmoid()(x), which we used earlier. torch.nn.Sigmoid is a class to which you can pass in parameters to construct an object in order to control the behavior.

How- ever, the advantage is that this allows us, as developers, to combine such basic operations and build more complex models. We then explored torch.nn, which makes building NN models a lot easier than implementing them from scratch.

Now that we have some hands-on experience with PyTorch neural network training and machine learning, it\u2019s time to take a deeper dive into the PyTorch library and explore its rich set of features, which will allow us to implement more advanced deep learning models in upcoming chapters.

After its initial release in 2016 and its 1.0 release in 2018, PyTorch has evolved into one of the two most popular frameworks for deep learning. It uses dynamic computational graphs, which have the advantage of being more flexible compared to its static counterparts. Dynamic computational graphs are debugging friendly: PyTorch allows for interleaving the graph declaration and graph evaluation steps. You can execute the code line by line while having full access to all variables. This is a very important feature that makes the development and training of NNs very convenient. While PyTorch is an open-source library and can be used for free by everyone, its development is funded and supported by Facebook. This involves a large team of software engineers who expand and improve the library continuously. Since PyTorch is an open-source library, it also has strong support from other developers outside of Facebook, who avidly contribute and provide user feedback. This has made the PyTorch library more useful to both academic researchers and developers. A further conse- quence of these factors is that PyTorch has extensive documentation and tutorials to help new users. Another key feature of PyTorch, which was also noted in the previous chapter, is its ability to work with single or multiple graphical processing units (GPUs). This allows users to train deep learning models very efficiently on large datasets and large-scale systems. Last but not least, PyTorch supports mobile deployment, which also makes it a very suitable tool for production. In the next section, we will look at how a tensor and function in PyTorch are interconnected via a computation graph. PyTorch\u2019s computation graphs PyTorch performs its computations based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this section, we will see how these graphs can be defined for a simple arithmetic computation. Then, we will see the dy- namic graph paradigm, as well as how the graph is created on the fly in PyTorch. Understanding computation graphs PyTorch relies on building a computation graph at its core, and it uses this computation graph to derive relationships between tensors from the input all the way to the output. Let\u2019s say that we have rank 0 (scalar) tensors a, b, and c and we want to evaluate z = 2 \u00d7 (a \u2013 b) + c.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 439, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

PyTorch builds this computation graph and uses it to compute the gradients accordingly. In the next subsection, we will see some examples of creating a graph for this computation using PyTorch. Creating a graph in PyTorch Let\u2019s look at a simple example that illustrates how to create a graph in PyTorch for evaluating z = 2 \u00d7 (a \u2013 b) + c, as shown in the previous figure. The variables a, b, and c are scalars (single numbers), and we define these as PyTorch tensors. To create the graph, we can simply define a regular Python function with a, b, and c as its input arguments, for example: >>> import torch >>> def compute_z(a, b, c): ... r1 = torch.sub(a, b) ... r2 = torch.mul(r1, 2) ... z = torch.add(r2, c) ... return z", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 440, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Note that PyTorch functions such as add, sub (or subtract), and mul (or multiply) also allow us to provide inputs of higher ranks in the form of a PyTorch tensor object. In the following code example, we provide scalar inputs (rank 0), as well as rank 1 and rank 2 inputs, as lists: >>> print('Scalar Inputs:', compute_z(torch.tensor(1), ... torch.tensor(2), torch.tensor(3))) Scalar Inputs: tensor(1) >>> print('Rank 1 Inputs:', compute_z(torch.tensor([1]), ... torch.tensor([2]), torch.tensor([3]))) Rank 1 Inputs: tensor([1]) >>> print('Rank 2 Inputs:', compute_z(torch.tensor([[1]]), ... torch.tensor([[2]]), torch.tensor([[3]]))) Rank 2 Inputs: tensor([[1]]) In this section, you saw how simple it is to create a computation graph in PyTorch. Next, we will look at PyTorch tensors that can be used for storing and updating model parameters. PyTorch tensor objects for storing and updating model parameters We covered tensor objects in Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch. In PyTorch, a special tensor object for which gradients need to be computed allows us to store and update the pa- rameters of our models during training. Such a tensor can be created by just assigning requires_grad to True on user-specified initial values. Note that as of now (mid-2021), only tensors of floating point and complex dtype can require gradients. In the following code, we will generate tensor objects of type float32: >>> a = torch.tensor(3.14, requires_grad=True) >>> print(a) tensor(3.1400, requires_grad=True) >>> b = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True) >>> print(b) tensor([1., 2., 3.], requires_grad=True)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 441, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

When creating a PyTorch tensor, we can also use a random initialization scheme. PyTorch can generate random numbers based on a variety of proba- bility distributions (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#random-sampling). In the following example, we will take a look at some standard initialization methods that are also available in the torch.nn.init module (see https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html). So, let\u2019s look at how we can create a tensor with Glorot initialization, which is a classic random ini- tialization scheme that was proposed by Xavier Glorot and Yoshua Bengio. For this, we first create an empty tensor and an operator called init as an object of class GlorotNormal. Then, we fill this tensor with values according to the Glorot initialization by calling the xavier_normal_() method. In the following example, we initialize a tensor of shape 2\u00d73: >>> import torch.nn as nn >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> w = torch.empty(2, 3) >>> nn.init.xavier_normal_(w) >>> print(w) tensor([[ 0.4183, 0.1688, 0.0390], [ 0.3930, -0.2858, -0.1051]]) method_() is an in-place method in PyTorch that is used for operations without making a copy of the input.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 442, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Xavier (or Glorot) initialization In the early development of deep learning, it was observed that random uniform or random normal weight initialization could often result in poor model performance during training. In 2010, Glorot and Bengio investigated the effect of initialization and proposed a novel, more robust initialization scheme to facilitate the training of deep networks. The general idea behind Xavier initialization is to roughly balance the variance of the gradients across different layers. Otherwise, some layers may get too much attention during training while the other layers lag behind. According to the research paper by Glorot and Bengio, if we want to initialize the weights in a uniform distribution, we should choose the interval of this uniform distribution as follows: \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a \u221a6 \u221a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56+ \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c , \u221a6 \u221a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56+ \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c ) Here, nin is the number of input neurons that are multiplied by the weights, and nout is the number of output neurons that feed into the next layer.

This is required for optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In addition, gradients have other applications, such as diagnosing the network to find out why an NN model is making a particular prediction for a test example. Therefore, in this section, we will cover how to compute gradients of a computation with respect to its input variables. Computing the gradients of the loss with respect to trainable variables PyTorch supports automatic differentiation, which can be thought of as an implementation of the chain rule for computing gradients of nested functions. Note that for the sake of simplicity, we will use the term gradient to refer to both partial derivatives and gradients. When we define a series of operations that results in some output or even intermediate tensors, PyTorch provides a context for calculating gradients of these computed tensors with respect to its dependent nodes in the computation graph. To compute these gradients, we can call the backward method from the torch.autograd module. It computes the sum of gradients of the given tensor with regard to leaf nodes (terminal nodes) in the graph. Let\u2019s work with a simple example where we will compute z = wx + b and define the loss as the squared loss between the target y and prediction z, Loss = (y \u2013 z) 2. In the more general case, where we may have multiple predictions and targets, we compute the loss as the sum of the squared error, \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\u2211(\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)2 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 . In order to implement this computation in PyTorch, we will define the model parameters, w and b, as variables (tensors with the requires_gradient attribute set to True), and the input, x and y, as default tensors. We will compute the loss tensor and use it to compute the gradients of the model parameters, w and b, as follows: >>> w = torch.tensor(1.0, requires_grad=True) >>> b = torch.tensor(0.5, requires_grad=True) >>> x = torch.tensor([1.4]) >>> y = torch.tensor([2.1]) >>> z = torch.add(torch.mul(w, x), b) >>> loss = (y-z).pow(2).sum() Partial derivatives and gradients A partial derivative \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15 \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf15\ud835\udf151 can be understood as the rate of change of a multivariate func- tion\u2014a function with multiple inputs, f(x1, x2, ...), with respect to one of its inputs (here: x1).

Understanding automatic differentiation Automatic differentiation represents a set of computational techniques for computing gradients of arbitrary arithmetic operations. During this process, gradients of a computation (expressed as a series of operations) are obtained by accumulating the gradients through repeated applications of the chain rule. To better understand the concept behind automatic differentiation, let\u2019s consider a series of nested computations, y = f(g(h(x))), with input x and output y. This can be broken into a series of steps: \u2022 u0 = x \u2022 u1 = h(x) \u2022 u2 = g(u1) \u2022 u3 = f(u2) = y The derivative \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 can be computed in two different ways: forward accumulation, which starts with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc513 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51= \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc513 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc512 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc512 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc510 , and reverse accumulation, which starts with \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc510 = \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc511 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc511 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc510 . Note that PyTorch uses the latter, reverse accumulation, which is more efficient for implementing backpropagation. Adversarial examples Computing gradients of the loss with respect to the input example is used for generating adversari- al examples (or adversarial attacks). In computer vision, adversarial examples are examples that are generated by adding some small, imperceptible noise (or perturbations) to the input example, which results in a deep NN misclassifying them.

Before we take a deeper dive into nn.Module, let\u2019s briefly look at another approach for conjuring those layers via nn.Sequential. Implementing models based on nn.Sequential With nn.Sequential (https://pytorch.org/docs/master/generated/torch.nn.Sequential. html#sequential), the layers stored inside the model are connected in a cascaded way. In the follow- ing example, we will build a model with two densely (fully) connected layers: >>> model = nn.Sequential( ... nn.Linear(4, 16), ... nn.ReLU(), ... nn.Linear(16, 32), ... nn.ReLU() ... ) >>> model Sequential( (0): Linear(in_features=4, out_features=16, bias=True) (1): ReLU() (2): Linear(in_features=16, out_features=32, bias=True) (3): ReLU() ) We specified the layers and instantiated the model after passing the layers to the nn.Sequential class. The output of the first fully connected layer is used as the input to the first ReLU layer. The output of the first ReLU layer becomes the input for the second fully connected layer. Finally, the output of the second fully connected layer is used as the input to the second ReLU layer. We can further configure these layers, for example, by applying different activation functions, initial- izers, or regularization methods to the parameters. A comprehensive and complete list of available options for most of these categories can be found in the official documentation: \u2022 Choosing activation functions: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear- activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity \u2022 Initializing the layer parameters via nn.init: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init. html \u2022 Applying L2 regularization to the layer parameters (to prevent overfitting) via the parameter weight_decay of some optimizers in torch.optim: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim. html", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 446, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The choice of loss function depends on the task; for example, you might use mean square error loss for a regression problem. The family of cross-entropy loss functions supplies the possible choices for classification tasks, which are extensively discussed in Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, you can use the techniques you have learned from previous chapters (such as techniques for model evaluation from Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning) combined with the appropriate metrics for the problem. For example, precision and recall, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and false negative and false positive scores are appropriate metrics for evaluating classification models.

Then, we will cover building a model via nn.Module that will give us more flexibility and control over the layers of the network. Solving an XOR classification problem The XOR classification problem is a classic problem for analyzing the capacity of a model with regard to capturing the nonlinear decision boundary between two classes. We generate a toy dataset of 200 training examples with two features (x0, x1) drawn from a uniform distribution between [\u20131, 1).

As a general rule of thumb, the more layers we have, and the more neurons we have in each layer, the larger the capacity of the model will be. Here, the model capacity can be thought of as a measure of how readily the model can approximate complex functions. While having more parameters means the network can fit more complex functions, larger models are usually harder to train (and prone to overfitting). In practice, it is always a good idea to start with a simple model as a baseline, for example, a single-layer NN like logistic regression: >>> model = nn.Sequential( ... nn.Linear(2, 1), ... nn.Sigmoid() ... ) >>> model Sequential( (0): Linear(in_features=2, out_features=1, bias=True) (1): Sigmoid() )", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 449, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As a consequence, we can observe that the loss terms for both the training and the validation datasets are very high, and the classification accuracy is very low. To derive a nonlinear decision boundary, we can add one or more hidden layers connected via nonlinear activation functions. The universal approximation theorem states that a feedforward NN with a single hidden layer and a relatively large number of hidden units can approximate arbitrary continuous func- tions relatively well. Thus, one approach for tackling the XOR problem more satisfactorily is to add a hidden layer and compare different numbers of hidden units until we observe satisfactory results on the validation dataset. Adding more hidden units would correspond to increasing the width of a layer. Alternatively, we can also add more hidden layers, which will make the model deeper.

This is a very common and convenient way of building models. However, it unfortu- nately doesn\u2019t allow us to create more complex models that have multiple input, output, or intermediate branches. That\u2019s where nn.Module comes in handy. The alternative way to build complex models is by subclassing nn.Module. In this approach, we create a new class derived from nn.Module and define the method, __init__(), as a constructor. The forward() method is used to specify the forward pass. In the constructor function, __init__(), we define the layers as attributes of the class so that they can be accessed via the self reference attribute. Then, in the forward() method, we specify how these layers are to be used in the forward pass of the NN. The code for defining a new class that implements the previous model is as follows: >>> class MyModule(nn.Module): ... def __init__(self): ... super().__init__() ... l1 = nn.Linear(2, 4) ... a1 = nn.ReLU() ... l2 = nn.Linear(4, 4) ... a2 = nn.ReLU() ... l3 = nn.Linear(4, 1) ... a3 = nn.Sigmoid() ... l = [l1, a1, l2, a2, l3, a3] ... self.module_list = nn.ModuleList(l) ... ... def forward(self, x): ... for f in self.module_list: ... x = f(x) ... return x Notice that we put all layers in the nn.ModuleList object, which is just a list object composed of nn.Module items. This makes the code more readable and easier to follow. Once we define an instance of this new class, we can train it as we did previously: >>> model = MyModule() >>> model MyModule( (module_list): ModuleList( (0): Linear(in_features=2, out_features=4, bias=True) (1): ReLU() (2): Linear(in_features=4, out_features=4, bias=True) (3): ReLU()", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 453, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Mlxtend can be installed via conda or pip as follows: conda install mlxtend -c conda-forge pip install mlxtend To compute the decision boundary of our model, we need to add a predict() method in the MyModule class: >>> def predict(self, x): ... x = torch.tensor(x, dtype=torch.float32) ... pred = self.forward(x)[:, 0] ... return (pred>=0.5).float() It will return the predicted class (0 or 1) for a sample.

This is especially useful when designing a new layer or customizing an existing layer. To illustrate the concept of implementing custom layers, let\u2019s consider a simple example. Imagine we want to define a new linear layer that computes \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f, where \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16 refers to a random variable as a noise variable. To implement this computation, we define a new class as a subclass of nn.Module. For this new class, we have to define both the constructor __init__() method and the forward() method. In the constructor, we define the variables and other required tensors for our customized layer. We can create variables and initialize them in the constructor if the input_size is given to the constructor. Alternatively, we can delay the variable initialization (for instance, if we do not know the exact input shape upfront) and delegate it to another method for late variable creation. To look at a concrete example, we are going to define a new layer called NoisyLinear, which imple- ments the computation \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65) + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f, which was mentioned in the preceding paragraph: >>> class NoisyLinear(nn.Module): ... def __init__(self, input_size, output_size, ... noise_stddev=0.1): ... super().__init__() ... w = torch.Tensor(input_size, output_size) ... self.w = nn.Parameter(w) # nn.Parameter is a Tensor ... # that's a module parameter.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 455, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Furthermore, notice that in the forward() method, we have used an additional argument, training=False. We use it to distinguish whether the layer is used during training or only for prediction (this is sometimes also called infer- ence) or evaluation. Also, there are certain methods that behave differently in training and prediction modes. You will encounter an example of such a method, Dropout, in the upcoming chapters. In the previous code snippet, we also specified that the random vector, \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16 , was to be generated and added to the input during training only and not used for inference or evaluation. Before we go a step further and use our custom NoisyLinear layer in a model, let\u2019s test it in the context of a simple example. 1. In the following code, we will define a new instance of this layer, and execute it on an input tensor. Then, we will call the layer three times on the same input tensor: >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> noisy_layer = NoisyLinear(4, 2) >>> x = torch.zeros((1, 4)) >>> print(noisy_layer(x, training=True)) tensor([[ 0.1154, -0.0598]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>) >>> print(noisy_layer(x, training=True)) tensor([[ 0.0432, -0.0375]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>) >>> print(noisy_layer(x, training=False)) tensor([[0., 0.]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 456, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The full dataset and its descrip- tion are available from UCI\u2019s machine learning repository at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ datasets/auto+mpg. We are going to treat five features from the Auto MPG dataset (number of cylinders, displacement, horsepower, weight, and acceleration) as \u201cnumeric\u201d (here, continuous) features.

These columns will constitute the continuous features. Next, let\u2019s group the rather fine-grained model year (ModelYear) information into buckets to simplify the learning task for the model that we are going to train later. Concretely, we are going to assign each car into one of four year buckets, as follows: bucket = { 0 if year < 73 1 if 73 \u2264year < 76 2 if 76 \u2264year < 79 3 if year \u226579 Note that the chosen intervals were selected arbitrarily to illustrate the concepts of \u201cbucketing.\u201d In order to group the cars into these buckets, we will first define three cut-off values: [73, 76, 79] for the model year feature. These cut-off values are used to specify half-closed intervals, for instance, (\u2013\u221e, 73), [73, 76), [76, 79), and [76, \u221e). Then, the original numeric features will be passed to the torch.bucketize function (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.bucketize.html) to generate the indices of the buckets. The code is as follows: >>> boundaries = torch.tensor([73, 76, 79]) >>> v = torch.tensor(df_train_norm['Model Year'].values) >>> df_train_norm['Model Year Bucketed'] = torch.bucketize(", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 462, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Next, we will proceed with defining a list for the unordered categorical feature, Origin. In PyTorch, There are two ways to work with a categorical feature: using an embedding layer via nn.Embedding (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Embedding.html), or using one-hot-en- coded vectors (also called indicator). In the encoding approach, for example, index 0 will be encoded as [1, 0, 0], index 1 will be encoded as [0, 1, 0], and so on. On the other hand, the embedding layer maps each index to a vector of random numbers of the type float, which can be trained. (You can think of the embedding layer as a more efficient implementation of a one-hot encoding multiplied with a trainable weight matrix.) When the number of categories is large, using the embedding layer with fewer dimensions than the number of categories can improve the performance. In the following code snippet, we will use the one-hot-encoding approach on the categorical feature in order to convert it into the dense format: >>> from torch.nn.functional import one_hot >>> total_origin = len(set(df_train_norm['Origin'])) >>> origin_encoded = one_hot(torch.from_numpy( ... df_train_norm['Origin'].values) % total_origin) >>> x_train_numeric = torch.tensor( ... df_train_norm[numeric_column_names].values) >>> x_train = torch.cat([x_train_numeric, origin_encoded], 1).float() >>> origin_encoded = one_hot(torch.from_numpy( ... df_test_norm['Origin'].values) % total_origin) >>> x_test_numeric = torch.tensor( ... df_test_norm[numeric_column_names].values) >>> x_test = torch.cat([x_test_numeric, origin_encoded], 1).float() After encoding the categorical feature into a three-dimensional dense feature, we concatenated it with the numeric features we processed in the previous step.

Higher-level PyTorch APIs: a short introduction to PyTorch-Lightning In recent years, the PyTorch community developed several different libraries and APIs on top of Py- Torch. Notable examples include fastai (https://docs.fast.ai/), Catalyst (https://github.com/ catalyst-team/catalyst), PyTorch Lightning (https://www.pytorchlightning.ai), (https:// lightning-flash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html), and PyTorch-Ignite (https:// github.com/pytorch/ignite).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 468, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, while Lightning\u2019s focus lies in simplicity and flexibility, it also allows us to use many advanced features such as multi-GPU support and fast low-precision training, which you can learn about in the official documentation at https://pytorch-lightning.rtfd.io/en/latest/. In an earlier section, Project two \u2013 classifying MNIST handwritten digits, we implemented a multilayer perceptron for classifying handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. In the next subsections, we will reimplement this classifier using Lightning. Setting up the PyTorch Lightning model We start by implementing the model, which we will train in the next subsections. Defining a model for Lightning is relatively straightforward as it is based on regular Python and PyTorch code. All that is required to implement a Lightning model is to use LightningModule instead of the regular PyTorch module. To take advantage of PyTorch\u2019s convenience functions, such as the trainer API and automatic logging, we just define a few specifically named methods, which we will see in the following code: import pytorch_lightning as pl import torch import torch.nn as nn from torchmetrics import Accuracy class MultiLayerPerceptron(pl.LightningModule): def __init__(self, image_shape=(1, 28, 28), hidden_units=(32, 16)): super().__init__() There is also a bonus introduction to PyTorch-Ignite at https://github.com/rasbt/ machine-learning-book/blob/main/ch13/ch13_part4_ignite.ipynb. Installing PyTorch Lightning Lightning can be installed via pip or conda, depending on your preference. For instance, the command for installing Lightning via pip is as follows: pip install pytorch-lightning The following is the command for installing Lightning via conda: conda install pytorch-lightning -c conda-forge The code in the following subsections is based on PyTorch Lightning version 1.5, which you can install by replacing pytorch-lightning with pytorch-lightning==1.5 in these commands.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 469, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As you can see, the __init__ constructor contains the same model code that we used in a previous subsection. What\u2019s new is that we added the accuracy attributes such as self.train_acc = Accuracy(). These will allow us to track the accuracy during training. Accuracy was imported from the torchmetrics module, which should be automatically installed with Lightning. If you cannot import torchmetrics, you can try to install it via pip install torchmetrics. More information can be found at https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ pages/quickstart.html. The forward method implements a simple forward pass that returns the logits (outputs of the last fully connected layer of our network before the softmax layer) when we call our model on the input data. The logits, computed via the forward method by calling self(x), are used for the training, validation, and test steps, which we\u2019ll describe next. The training_step, training_epoch_end, validation_step, test_step, and configure_optimizers methods are methods that are specifically recognized by Lightning. For instance, training_step de- fines a single forward pass during training, where we also keep track of the accuracy and loss so that we can analyze these later. Note that we compute the accuracy via self.train_acc.update(preds, y) but don\u2019t log it yet. The training_step method is executed on each individual batch during training, and via the training_epoch_end method, which is executed at the end of each training epoch, we compute the training set accuracy from the accuracy values we accumulated via training. The validation_step and test_step methods define, analogous to the training_step method, how the validation and test evaluation process should be computed. Similar to training_step, each validation_step and test_step receives a single batch, which is why we log the accuracy via respective accuracy attributes derived from Accuracy of torchmetric. However, note that validation_step is only called in certain intervals, for example, after each training epoch. This is why we log the validation accuracy inside the validation step, whereas with the training accuracy, we log it after each training epoch, otherwise, the accuracy plot that we inspect later will look too noisy.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 471, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The fol- lowing two subsections will discuss how we can set up the dataset and how we can train the model.

We can: \u2022 Make the dataset part of the model \u2022 Set up the data loaders as usual and feed them to the fit method of a Lightning Trainer\u2014the Trainer is introduced in the next subsection \u2022 Create a LightningDataModule Here, we are going to use a LightningDataModule, which is the most organized approach. The LightningDataModule consists of five main methods, as we can see in the following: from torch.utils.data import DataLoader from torch.utils.data import random_split from torchvision.datasets import MNIST from torchvision import transforms class MnistDataModule(pl.LightningDataModule): def __init__(self, data_path='./'): super().__init__() self.data_path = data_path self.transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor()]) def prepare_data(self): MNIST(root=self.data_path, download=True) def setup(self, stage=None): # stage is either 'fit', 'validate', 'test', or 'predict' # here note relevant mnist_all = MNIST( root=self.data_path, train=True, transform=self.transform, download=False ) self.train, self.val = random_split( mnist_all, [55000, 5000], generator=torch.Generator().manual_ seed(1) )", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 472, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In the setup method, we define the datasets used for training, validation, and testing. Note that MNIST does not have a dedicated validation split, which is why we use the random_split function to divide the 60,000-ex- ample training set into 55,000 examples for training and 5,000 examples for validation. The data loader methods are self-explanatory and define how the respective datasets are loaded. Now, we can initialize the data module and use it for training, validation, and testing in the next subsections: torch.manual_seed(1) mnist_dm = MnistDataModule() Training the model using the PyTorch Lightning Trainer class Now we can reap the rewards from setting up the model with the specifically named methods, as well as the Lightning data module. Lightning implements a Trainer class that makes the training model super convenient by taking care of all the intermediate steps, such as calling zero_grad(), backward(), and optimizer.step() for us. Also, as a bonus, it lets us easily specify one or more GPUs to use (if available): mnistclassifier = MultiLayerPerceptron() if torch.cuda.is_available(): # if you have GPUs trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=10, gpus=1) else: trainer = pl.Trainer(max_epochs=10) trainer.fit(model=mnistclassifier, datamodule=mnist_dm)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 473, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Evaluating the model using TensorBoard In the previous section, we experienced the convenience of the Trainer class. Another nice feature of Lightning is its logging capabilities. Recall that we specified several self.log steps in our Light- ning model earlier. After, and even during training, we can visualize them in TensorBoard. (Note that Lightning supports other loggers as well; for more information, please see the official documentation at https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/common/loggers.html.)

If you want to reuse the model later, you can conveniently load it via the following code: model = MultiLayerPerceptron.load_from_checkpoint(\"path/to/checkpoint.ckpt\") Summary In this chapter, we covered PyTorch\u2019s most essential and useful features. We started by discussing PyTorch\u2019s dynamic computation graph, which makes implementing computations very convenient. We also covered the semantics of defining PyTorch tensor objects as model parameters. After we considered the concept of computing partial derivatives and gradients of arbitrary functions, we covered the torch.nn module in more detail. It provides us with a user-friendly interface for building more complex deep NN models. Finally, we concluded this chapter by solving a regression and classification problem using what we have discussed so far. Now that we have covered the core mechanics of PyTorch, the next chapter will introduce the concept behind convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for deep learning. CNNs are powerful models and have shown great performance in the field of computer vision.

Several years later, in 2019, Yann LeCun received the Turing award (the most prestigious award in computer science) for his contributions to the field of artificial intelligence (AI), along with two other researchers, Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, whose names you encountered in previous chapters. In the following sections, we will discuss the broader concepts of CNNs and why convolutional ar- chitectures are often described as \u201cfeature extraction layers.\u201d Then, we will delve into the theoretical definition of the type of convolution operation that is commonly used in CNNs and walk through examples of computing convolutions in one and two dimensions. Understanding CNNs and feature hierarchies Successfully extracting salient (relevant) features is key to the performance of any machine learning algorithm, and traditional machine learning models rely on input features that may come from a domain expert or are based on computational feature extraction techniques. Certain types of NNs, such as CNNs, can automatically learn the features from raw data that are most useful for a particular task. For this reason, it\u2019s common to consider CNN layers as feature extractors: the early layers (those right after the input layer) extract low-level features from raw data, and the later layers (often fully connected layers, as in a multilayer perceptron (MLP)) use these features to predict a continuous target value or class label. Certain types of multilayer NNs, and in particular, deep CNNs, construct a so-called feature hierarchy by combining the low-level features in a layer-wise fashion to form high-level features. For example, if we\u2019re dealing with images, then low-level features, such as edges and blobs, are extracted from the earlier layers, which are combined to form high-level features. These high-level features can form more complex shapes, such as the general contours of objects like buildings, cats, or dogs. The human visual cortex The original discovery of how the visual cortex of our brain functions was made by David H. Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in 1959, when they inserted a microelectrode into the primary visual cortex of an anesthetized cat. They observed that neurons respond differently after projecting different patterns of light in front of the cat. This eventually led to the discovery of the different layers of the visual cortex. While the primary layer mainly detects edges and straight lines, higher-order layers focus more on extracting complex shapes and patterns.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 481, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

CNNs will usually perform very well on image-related tasks, and that\u2019s largely due to two important ideas: \u2022 Sparse connectivity: A single element in the feature map is connected to only a small patch of pixels. (This is very different from connecting to the whole input image, as in the case of MLPs. You may find it useful to look back and compare how we implemented a fully connected network that connected to the whole image in Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch.) \u2022 Parameter sharing: The same weights are used for different patches of the input image. As a direct consequence of these two ideas, replacing a conventional, fully connected MLP with a convolution layer substantially decreases the number of weights (parameters) in the network, and we will see an improvement in the ability to capture salient features. In the context of image data, it makes sense to assume that nearby pixels are typically more relevant to each other than pixels that are far away from each other. Typically, CNNs are composed of several convolutional and subsampling layers that are followed by one or more fully connected layers at the end. The fully connected layers are essentially an MLP, where every input unit, i, is connected to every output unit, j, with weight wij (which we covered in more detail in Chapter 11). Please note that subsampling layers, commonly known as pooling layers, do not have any learnable parameters; for instance, there are no weights or bias units in pooling layers.

To understand how convolution operations work, let\u2019s start with a convolution in one dimension, which is sometimes used for working with certain types of sequence data, such as text. After discussing one-dimensional convolutions, we will work through the typical two-dimensional ones that are commonly applied to two-dimensional images. Performing discrete convolutions A discrete convolution (or simply convolution) is a fundamental operation in a CNN. Therefore, it\u2019s important to understand how this operation works. In this section, we will cover the mathematical definition and discuss some of the naive algorithms to compute convolutions of one-dimensional tensors (vectors) and two-dimensional tensors (matrices). Please note that the formulas and descriptions in this section are solely for understanding how con- volution operations in CNNs work. Indeed, much more efficient implementations of convolutional operations already exist in packages such as PyTorch, as you will see later in this chapter. Discrete convolutions in one dimension Let\u2019s start with some basic definitions and notations that we are going to use. A discrete convolution for two vectors, x and w, is denoted by \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a , in which vector x is our input (sometimes called signal) and w is called the filter or kernel. A discrete convolution is mathematically defined as follows: \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] = \u2211\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64[\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] +\u221e \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 As mentioned earlier, the brackets, [ ], are used to denote the indexing for vector elements. The index, i, runs through each element of the output vector, y. There are two odd things in the preceding formula that we need to clarify: \u2013\u221e to +\u221e indices and negative indexing for x. Mathematical notation In this chapter, we will use subscript to denote the size of a multidimensional array (ten- sor); for example, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b1\u00d7\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b2 is a two-dimensional array of size n1\u00d7n2. We use brackets, [ ], to denote the indexing of a multidimensional array. For example, A[i, j] refers to the element at index i, j of matrix A. Furthermore, note that we use a special symbol, \u2217, to denote the convolution operation between two vectors or matrices, which is not to be confused with the multiplication operator, *, in Python.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 483, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For example, if x has 10 features with indices 0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9, then indices \u2013\u221e: \u20131 and 10: +\u221e are out of bounds for x. Therefore, to correctly compute the summation shown in the preceding formula, it is assumed that x and w are filled with zeros. This will result in an output vector, y, that also has infinite size, with lots of zeros as well. Since this is not useful in practical situations, x is padded only with a finite number of zeros. This process is called zero-padding or simply padding. Here, the number of zeros padded on each side is denoted by p. An example padding of a one-dimensional vector, x, is shown in Figure 14.2: Figure 14.2: An example of padding Let\u2019s assume that the original input, x, and filter, w, have n and m elements, respectively, where \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a. Therefore, the padded vector, x p, has size n + 2p. The practical formula for computing a discrete con- volution will change to the following: \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] = \u2211\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64[\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 Now that we have solved the infinite index issue, the second issue is indexing x with i + m \u2013 k. The important point to notice here is that x and w are indexed in different directions in this summation. Computing the sum with one index going in the reverse direction is equivalent to computing the sum with both indices in the forward direction after flipping one of those vectors, x or w, after they are padded. Then, we can simply compute their dot product. Let\u2019s assume we flip (rotate) the filter, w, to get the rotated filter, w r. Then, the dot product, x[i: i + m].w r, is computed to get one element, y[i], where x[i: i + m] is a patch of x with size m. This operation is repeated like in a sliding window approach to get all the output elements.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 484, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Notice that the rotated filter, w r, is shifted by two cells each time we shift. This shift is another hyperparameter of a convolution, the stride, s. In this example, the stride is two, s = 2. Note that the stride has to be a positive number smaller than the size of the input vector. We will talk more about padding and strides in the next section.

Technically, padding can be applied with any \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d. Depending on the choice of p, boundary cells may be treated differently than the cells located in the middle of x. Now, consider an example where n = 5 and m = 3. Then, with p = 0, x[0] is only used in computing one output element (for instance, y[0]), while x[1] is used in the computation of two output elements (for instance, y[0] and y[1]). So, you can see that this different treatment of elements of x can artificially put more emphasis on the middle element, x[2], since it has appeared in most computations. We can avoid this issue if we choose p = 2, in which case, each element of x will be involved in computing three elements of y. Furthermore, the size of the output, y, also depends on the choice of the padding strategy we use. There are three modes of padding that are commonly used in practice: full, same, and valid. In full mode, the padding parameter, p, is set to p = m \u2013 1. Full padding increases the dimensions of the output; thus, it is rarely used in CNN architectures. The same padding mode is usually used to ensure that the output vector has the same size as the input vector, x. In this case, the padding parameter, p, is computed according to the filter size, along with the requirement that the input size and output size are the same. Finally, computing a convolution in valid mode refers to the case where p = 0 (no padding). Figure 14.4 illustrates the three different padding modes for a simple 5\u00d75 pixel input with a kernel size of 3\u00d73 and a stride of 1: Figure 14.4: The three modes of padding The most commonly used padding mode in CNNs is same padding.

In practice, you should preserve the spatial size using same padding for the convolutional layers and decrease the spatial size via pooling layers or convolutional layers with stride 2 instead, as described in Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net ICLR (workshop track), by Jost Tobias Springenberg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, and others, 2015 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806). As for full padding, its size results in an output larger than the input size. Full padding is usually used in signal processing applications where it is important to minimize boundary effects. However, in a deep learning context, boundary effects are usually not an issue, so we rarely see full padding being used in practice. Determining the size of the convolution output The output size of a convolution is determined by the total number of times that we shift the filter, w, along the input vector.

Figure 14.5 demonstrates the 2D convolution of an input matrix of size 8\u00d78, using a kernel of size 3\u00d73. The input matrix is padded with zeros with p = 1. As a result, the output of the 2D convolution will have a size of 8\u00d78: Figure 14.5: The output of a 2D convolution The following example illustrates the computation of a 2D convolution between an input matrix, X3\u00d73, and a kernel matrix, W3\u00d73, using padding p = (1, 1) and stride s = (2, 2).

However, this implementation is very inefficient in terms of memory requirements and computational complexity. Therefore, it should not be used in real-world NN applications. One aspect is that the filter matrix is actually not rotated in most tools like PyTorch. More- over, in recent years, much more efficient algorithms have been developed that use the Fourier transform to compute convolutions. It is also important to note that in the context of NNs, the size of a convolution kernel is usually much smaller than the size of the input image. For example, modern CNNs usually use kernel sizes such as 1\u00d71, 3\u00d73, or 5\u00d75, for which effi- cient algorithms have been designed that can carry out the convolutional operations much more efficiently, such as Winograd\u2019s minimal filtering algorithm. These algorithms are beyond the scope of this book, but if you are interested in learning more, you can read the manuscript Fast Algorithms for Convolutional Neural Networks by Andrew Lavin and Scott Gray, 2015, which is freely available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09308.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 491, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Subsampling layers Subsampling is typically applied in two forms of pooling operations in CNNs: max-pooling and mean-pooling (also known as average-pooling). The pooling layer is usually denoted by \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b1\u00d7\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b2. Here, the subscript determines the size of the neighborhood (the number of adjacent pixels in each dimension) where the max or mean operation is performed. We refer to such a neighborhood as the pooling size. The operation is described in Figure 14.8. Here, max-pooling takes the maximum value from a neigh- borhood of pixels, and mean-pooling computes their average: Figure 14.8: An example of max-pooling and mean-pooling The advantage of pooling is twofold: \u2022 Pooling (max-pooling) introduces a local invariance. This means that small changes in a local neighborhood do not change the result of max-pooling. Therefore, it helps with generating features that are more robust to noise in the input data.

Instead of using pooling layers to reduce the feature size, researchers use convolutional layers with a stride of 2. In a sense, you can think of a convolutional layer with stride 2 as a pooling layer with learnable weights. If you are interested in an empirical comparison of different CNN architectures developed with and without pooling layers, we recommend reading the research article Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net by Jost Tobias Springenberg, Alexey Dosovitskiy, Thomas Brox, and Martin Riedmiller. This article is freely available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806. Putting everything together \u2013 implementing a CNN So far, you have learned about the basic building blocks of CNNs. The concepts illustrated in this chap- ter are not really more difficult than traditional multilayer NNs. We can say that the most important operation in a traditional NN is matrix multiplication. For instance, we use matrix multiplications to compute the pre-activations (or net inputs), as in z = Wx + b. Here, x is a column vector (\u211d\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b matrix) representing pixels, and W is the weight matrix connecting the pixel inputs to each hidden unit. In a CNN, this operation is replaced by a convolution operation, as in \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81, where X is a matrix representing the pixels in a height\u00d7width arrangement. In both cases, the pre-activations are passed to an activation function to obtain the activation of a hidden unit, \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68(\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81), where \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e is the activation function. Furthermore, you will recall that subsampling is another building block of a CNN, which may appear in the form of pooling, as was described in the previous section. Working with multiple input or color channels An input to a convolutional layer may contain one or more 2D arrays or matrices with dimensions N1\u00d7N2 (for example, the image height and width in pixels). These N1\u00d7N2 matrices are called channels. Conven- tional implementations of convolutional layers expect a rank-3 tensor representation as an input, for example, a three-dimensional array, \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc411\u00d7\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc412\u00d7\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, where Cin is the number of input channels. For example, let\u2019s consider images as input to the first layer of a CNN. If the image is colored and uses the RGB color mode, then Cin = 3 (for the red, green, and blue color channels in RGB). However, if the image is in gray- scale, then we have Cin = 1, because there is only one channel with the grayscale pixel intensity values. Overlapping versus non-overlapping pooling Traditionally, pooling is assumed to be non-overlapping. Pooling is typically performed on non-overlapping neighborhoods, which can be done by setting the stride parameter equal to the pooling size. For example, a non-overlapping pooling layer, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b1\u00d7\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b2, requires a stride parameter s = (n1, n2). On the other hand, overlapping pooling occurs if the stride is smaller than the pooling size. An example where overlapping pooling is used in a con- volutional network is described in ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and G. Hinton, 2012, which is freely available as a manuscript at https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification- with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 493, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The answer is very simple: we perform the convolution operation for each channel separately and then add the results together using the matrix summation. The convolution associated with each channel (c) has its own kernel matrix as W[:, :, c]. Reading an image file When we work with images, we can read images into NumPy arrays using the uint8 (unsigned 8-bit integer) data type to reduce memory usage compared to 16-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit integer types, for example. Unsigned 8-bit integers take values in the range [0, 255], which are sufficient to store the pixel information in RGB images, which also take values in the same range. In Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, you saw that PyTorch provides a module for loading/storing and manipulating images via torchvision.

Usually, a convolutional layer of a CNN has more than one feature map. If we use multiple feature maps, the kernel tensor becomes four-dimensional: width\u00d7height\u00d7Cin\u00d7Cout. Here, width\u00d7height is the kernel size, Cin is the number of input channels, and Cout is the number of output feature maps. So, now let\u2019s include the number of output feature maps in the preceding formula and update it, as follows: Given an example \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b1\u00d7\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b2\u00d7\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, a kernel matrix \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a1\u00d7\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a2\u00d7\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u00d7\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c, and a bias vector \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c \u27f9 { \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b[:, : , \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] = \u2211\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e[: , : , \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50] \u2217\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f[: , : , \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50] \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81[: , : , \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] = \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36[:, : , \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] + \ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f[\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68[: , : , \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58] = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81[: , : , \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58]) To conclude our discussion of computing convolutions in the context of NNs, let\u2019s look at the example in Figure 14.9, which shows a convolutional layer, followed by a pooling layer. In this example, there are three input channels. The kernel tensor is four-dimensional. Each kernel matrix is denoted as m1\u00d7m2, and there are three of them, one for each input channel. Furthermore, there are five such kernels, accounting for five output feature maps. Finally, there is a pooling layer for subsampling the feature maps: Figure 14.9: Implementing a CNN", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 495, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, convolutions can also be extended to 3D volumes if you are working with 3D datasets, for example, as shown in the paper VoxNet: A 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Real-Time Object Recognition by Daniel Maturana and Sebastian Scherer, 2015, which can be accessed at https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ pub_files/2015/9/voxnet_maturana_scherer_iros15.pdf. In the next section, we will talk about how to regularize an NN. Regularizing an NN with L2 regularization and dropout Choosing the size of a network, whether we are dealing with a traditional (fully connected) NN or a CNN, has always been a challenging problem. For instance, the size of a weight matrix and the number of layers need to be tuned to achieve a reasonably good performance. How many trainable parameters exist in the preceding example? To illustrate the advantages of convolution, parameter sharing, and sparse connectivity, let\u2019s work through an example. The convolutional layer in the network shown in Figure 14.9 is a four-dimensional tensor. So, there are m1\u00d7m2\u00d73\u00d75 parameters associated with the kernel. Furthermore, there is a bias vector for each output feature map of the convolu- tional layer. Thus, the size of the bias vector is 5. Pooling layers do not have any (trainable) parameters; therefore, we can write the following: m1 \u00d7 m2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 + 5 If the input tensor is of size n1\u00d7n2\u00d73, assuming that the convolution is performed with the same-padding mode, then the size of the output feature maps would be n1 \u00d7 n2 \u00d7 5. Note that if we use a fully connected layer instead of a convolutional layer, this number will be much larger. In the case of a fully connected layer, the number of parameters for the weight matrix to reach the same number of output units would have been as follows: (n1 \u00d7 n2 \u00d7 3) \u00d7 (n1 \u00d7 n2 \u00d7 5) = (n1 \u00d7 n2) 2 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 5 In addition, the size of the bias vector is n1 \u00d7 n2 \u00d7 5 (one bias element for each output unit). Given that m1 < n1 and m2 < n2, we can see that the difference in the number of trainable parameters is significant.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 496, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The capacity of a network refers to the level of complex- ity of the function that it can learn to approximate. Small networks, or networks with a relatively small number of parameters, have a low capacity and are therefore likely to underfit, resulting in poor performance, since they cannot learn the underlying structure of complex datasets. However, very large networks may result in overfitting, where the network will memorize the training data and do extremely well on the training dataset while achieving a poor performance on the held-out test dataset. When we deal with real-world machine learning problems, we do not know how large the network should be a priori. One way to address this problem is to build a network with a relatively large capacity (in practice, we want to choose a capacity that is slightly larger than necessary) to do well on the training dataset. Then, to prevent overfitting, we can apply one or multiple regularization schemes to achieve good generalization performance on new data, such as the held-out test dataset. In Chapters 3 and 4, we covered L1 and L2 regularization. Both techniques can prevent or reduce the effect of overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss that results in shrinking the weight parameters during training. While both L1 and L2 regularization can be used for NNs as well, with L2 being the more common choice of the two, there are other methods for regularizing NNs, such as dropout, which we discuss in this section. But before we move on to discussing dropout, to use L2 regularization within a convolutional or fully connected network (recall, fully connected layers are implemented via torch.nn.Linear in PyTorch), you can simply add the L2 penalty of a particular layer to the loss function in PyTorch, as follows: >>> import torch.nn as nn >>> loss_func = nn.BCELoss() >>> loss = loss_func(torch.tensor([0.9]), torch.tensor([1.0])) >>> l2_lambda = 0.001 >>> conv_layer = nn.Conv2d(in_channels=3, ... out_channels=5, ... kernel_size=5) >>> l2_penalty = l2_lambda * sum( ...

Srivastava, G. Hinton, A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, and R. Salakhutdin- ov, Journal of Machine Learning Research 15.1, pages 1929-1958, 2014, http://www.jmlr.org/papers/ volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf). Dropout is usually applied to the hidden units of higher layers and works as follows: during the training phase of an NN, a fraction of the hidden units is randomly dropped at every iteration with probability pdrop (or keep probability pkeep = 1 \u2013 pdrop). This dropout probability is determined by the user and the common choice is p = 0.5, as discussed in the previously mentioned article by Nitish Srivastava and others, 2014. When dropping a certain fraction of input neurons, the weights associated with the remaining neurons are rescaled to account for the missing (dropped) neurons. The effect of this random dropout is that the network is forced to learn a redundant representation of the data. Therefore, the network cannot rely on the activation of any set of hidden units, since they may be turned off at any time during training, and is forced to learn more general and robust patterns from the data. Weight decay versus L2 regularization An alternative way to use L2 regularization is by setting the weight_decay parameter in a PyTorch optimizer to a positive value, for example: optimizer = torch.optim.SGD( model.parameters(), weight_decay=l2_lambda, ... ) While L2 regularization and weight_decay are not strictly identical, it can be shown that they are equivalent when using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizers.

Figure 14.10 shows an example of applying dropout with probability p = 0.5 during the training phase, whereby half of the neurons will become inactive randomly (dropped units are selected randomly in each forward pass of training). However, during prediction, all neurons will contribute to computing the pre-activations of the next layer: Figure 14.10: Applying dropout during the training phase As shown here, one important point to remember is that units may drop randomly during training only, whereas for the evaluation (inference) phase, all the hidden units must be active (for instance, pdrop = 0 or pkeep = 1). To ensure that the overall activations are on the same scale during training and pre- diction, the activations of the active neurons have to be scaled appropriately (for example, by halving the activation if the dropout probability was set to p = 0.5). However, since it is inconvenient to always scale activations when making predictions, PyTorch and other tools scale the activations during training (for example, by doubling the activations if the dropout probability was set to p = 0.5). This approach is commonly referred to as inverse dropout. While the relationship is not immediately obvious, dropout can be interpreted as the consensus (av- eraging) of an ensemble of models. As discussed in Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning, in ensemble learning, we train several models independently. During prediction, we then use the consensus of all the trained models. We already know that model ensembles are known to perform better than single models. In deep learning, however, both training several models and collecting and averaging the output of multiple models is computationally expensive. Here, dropout offers a workaround, with an efficient way to train many models at once and compute their average predictions at test or prediction time.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 499, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, consider that in dropout, we have a different model for each mini-batch (due to setting the weights to zero randomly during each forward pass). Then, via iterating over the mini-batches, we essentially sample over M = 2 h models, where h is the number of hidden units. The restriction and aspect that distinguishes dropout from regular ensembling, however, is that we share the weights over these \u201cdifferent models,\u201d which can be seen as a form of regularization. Then, during \u201cinference\u201d (for instance, predicting the labels in the test dataset), we can average over all these different models that we sampled over during training. This is very expensive, though. Then, averaging the models, that is, computing the geometric mean of the class-membership proba- bility that is returned by a model, i, can be computed as follows: \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38= [\u220f\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d{\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56} \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 ] 1 \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40 Now, the trick behind dropout is that this geometric mean of the model ensembles (here, M models) can be approximated by scaling the predictions of the last (or final) model sampled during training by a factor of 1/(1 \u2013 p), which is much cheaper than computing the geometric mean explicitly using the previous equation. (In fact, the approximation is exactly equivalent to the true geometric mean if we consider linear models.) Loss functions for classification In Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, we saw different activation functions, such as ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Some of these activation functions, like ReLU, are mainly used in the intermediate (hidden) layers of an NN to add non-linearities to our model. But others, like sigmoid (for binary) and softmax (for multiclass), are added at the last (output) layer, which results in class-member- ship probabilities as the output of the model. If the sigmoid or softmax activations are not included at the output layer, then the model will compute the logits instead of the class-membership probabilities. Focusing on classification problems here, depending on the type of problem (binary versus multiclass) and the type of output (logits versus probabilities), we should choose the appropriate loss function to train our model. Binary cross-entropy is the loss function for a binary classification (with a single output unit), and categorical cross-entropy is the loss function for multiclass classification. In the torch.nn module, the categorical cross-entropy loss takes in ground truth labels as integers (for ex- ample, y=2, out of three classes, 0, 1, and 2).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 500, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Typically, when we have a binary classification task, the model returns a single output value for each example. We interpret this single model output as the proba- bility of the positive class (for example, class 1), P(class = 1|x). In a binary classification problem, it is implied that P(class = 0|x)= 1 \u2013 P(class = 1|x); hence, we do not need a second output unit in order to obtain the probability of the negative class. However, sometimes practitioners choose to return two outputs for each training example and interpret them as probabilities of each class: P(class = 0|x) versus P(class = 1|x). Then, in such a case, using a softmax function (instead of the logistic sigmoid) to normalize the outputs (so that they sum to 1) is recommended, and categorical cross-entropy is the appropriate loss function. Implementing a deep CNN using PyTorch In Chapter 13, as you may recall, we solved the handwritten digit recognition problem using the torch. nn module. You may also recall that we achieved about 95.6 percent accuracy using an NN with two linear hidden layers. Now, let\u2019s implement a CNN and see whether it can achieve a better predictive performance compared to the previous model for classifying handwritten digits. Note that the fully connected layers that we saw in Chapter 13 were able to perform well on this problem. However, in some applications, such as reading bank account numbers from handwritten digits, even tiny mistakes can be very costly. Therefore, it is crucial to reduce this error as much as possible. The multilayer CNN architecture The architecture of the network that we are going to implement is shown in Figure 14.12. The inputs are 28\u00d728 grayscale images.

Configuring CNN layers in PyTorch Constructing a layer with the Conv2d class requires us to specify the number of output channels (which is equivalent to the number of output feature maps, or the number of output filters) and kernel sizes. In addition, there are optional parameters that we can use to configure a convolutional layer. The most commonly used ones are the strides (with a default value of 1 in both x, y dimensions) and pad- ding, which controls the amount of implicit padding on both dimensions. Additional configuration parameters are listed in the official documentation: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/ torch.nn.Conv2d.html. It is worth mentioning that usually, when we read an image, the default dimension for the channels is the first dimension of the tensor array (or the second dimension considering the batch dimension). This is called the NCHW format, where N stands for the number of images within the batch, C stands for channels, and H and W stand for height and width, respectively. Note that the Conv2D class assumes that inputs are in NCHW format by default. (Other tools, such as TensorFlow, use NHWC format.) However, if you come across some data whose channels are placed at the last dimension, you would need to swap the axes in your data to move the channels to the first dimension (or the second dimension considering the batch dimension). After the layer is constructed, it can be called by providing a four-dimensional tensor, with the first dimension reserved for a batch of examples; the second dimension corresponds to the channel; and the other two dimensions are the spatial dimensions. As shown in the architecture of the CNN model that we want to build, each convolution layer is followed by a pooling layer for subsampling (reducing the size of feature maps). The MaxPool2d and AvgPool2d classes construct the max-pooling and average-pooling layers, respectively. The kernel_size argu- ment determines the size of the window (or neighborhood) that will be used to compute the max or mean operations. Furthermore, the stride parameter can be used to configure the pooling layer, as we discussed earlier. Finally, the Dropout class will construct the dropout layer for regularization, with the argument p that denotes the drop probability pdrop, which is used to determine the probability of dropping the input units during training, as we discussed earlier. When calling this layer, its behavior can be controlled via model.train() and model.eval(), to specify whether this call will be made during training or during the inference. When using dropout, alternating between these two modes is crucial to ensure that it behaves correctly; for instance, nodes are only randomly dropped during training, not evalu- ation or inference.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 505, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For each convolutional layer, we used a kernel of size 5\u00d75 and padding=2. As discussed earlier, using same padding mode preserves the spatial dimensions (vertical and horizontal dimensions) of the feature maps such that the inputs and outputs have the same height and width (and the number of channels may only differ in terms of the number of filters used). As mentioned before, the spatial dimension of the output feature map is calculated by: \ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 ] + 1 where n is the spatial dimension of the input feature map, and p, m, and s denote the padding, kernel size, and stride, respectively. We obtain p = 2 in order to achieve o = i. The max-pooling layers with pooling size 2\u00d72 and stride of 2 will reduce the spatial dimensions by half.

The first dimension corresponds to the batch dimension, for which we used 4 arbitrarily. The next layer that we want to add is a fully connected layer for implementing a classifier on top of our convolutional and pooling layers. The input to this layer must have rank 2, that is, shape [batch- size \u00d7 input_units]. Thus, we need to flatten the output of the previous layers to meet this requirement for the fully connected layer: >>> model.add_module('flatten', nn.Flatten()) >>> x = torch.ones((4, 1, 28, 28)) >>> model(x).shape torch.Size([4, 3136]) As the output shape indicates, the input dimensions for the fully connected layer are correctly set up.

As you saw in Chapter 12, the CelebA dataset contains 202,599 images of celebrities\u2019 faces. In addition, 40 binary facial attributes are available for each image, including whether a celebrity is smiling (or not) and their age (young or old). Based on what you have learned so far, the goal of this section is to build and train a CNN model for predicting the smile attribute from these face images. Here, for simplicity, we will only be using a small portion of the training data (16,000 training examples) to speed up the training process. However, to improve the generalization performance and reduce overfitting on such a small dataset, we will use a technique called data augmentation.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 511, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For instance, certain data augmentation techniques allow us to modify or even artificially synthesize more data and thereby boost the performance of a machine or deep learning model by reducing overfitting. While data augmentation is not only for image data, there is a set of transformations uniquely applicable to image data, such as cropping parts of an image, flipping, and changing the contrast, brightness, and saturation. Let\u2019s see some of these transformations that are available via the torchvision.transforms module. In the following code block, we will first get five examples from the celeba_train_dataset dataset and apply five different types of transformation: 1) cropping an image to a bounding box, 2) flipping an image horizontally, 3) adjusting the contrast, 4) adjusting the brightness, and 5) center-cropping an image and resizing the resulting image back to its original size, (218, 178).

Also note that the origin (the coordinates at the location denoted as (0, 0)) for images loaded by PyTorch (as well as other packages such as imageio) is the upper-left corner of the image. The transformations in the previous code block are deterministic. However, all such transformations can also be randomized, which is recommended for data augmentation during model training. For example, a random bounding box (where the coordinates of the upper-left corner are selected ran- domly) can be cropped from an image, an image can be randomly flipped along either the horizontal or vertical axes with a probability of 0.5, or the contrast of an image can be changed randomly, where the contrast_factor is selected at random, but with uniform distribution, from a range of values.

Alternatively, let\u2019s consider a new layer, called global average-pooling, which computes the average of each feature map separately, thereby reducing the hidden units to 256. We can then add a fully connected layer. Although we have not dis- cussed global average-pooling explicitly, it is conceptually very similar to other pooling layers. Global average-pooling can be viewed, in fact, as a special case of average-pooling when the pooling size is equal to the size of the input feature maps. To understand this, consider Figure 14.18, showing an example of input feature maps of shape batch- size\u00d78\u00d764\u00d764. The channels are numbered k =0, 1, ..., 7. The global average-pooling operation calculates the average of each channel so that the output will have the shape [batchsize\u00d78]. After this, we will squeeze the output of the global average-pooling layer.

Summary In this chapter, we learned about CNNs and their main components. We started with the convolution operation and looked at 1D and 2D implementations. Then, we covered another type of layer that is found in several common CNN architectures: the subsampling or so-called pooling layers. We primarily focused on the two most common forms of pooling: max-pooling and average-pooling. Next, putting all these individual concepts together, we implemented deep CNNs using the torch.nn module. The first network we implemented was applied to the already familiar MNIST handwritten digit recognition problem. Then, we implemented a second CNN on a more complex dataset consisting of face images and trained the CNN for smile classification. Along the way, you also learned about data augmentation and dif- ferent transformations that we can apply to face images using the torchvision.transforms module.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 526, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Typical machine learning algorithms for supervised learning assume that the input is independent and identically distributed (IID) data, which means that the training examples are mutually independent and have the same underlying distribution. In this regard, based on the mutual independence assumption, the order in which the training examples are given to the model is irrelevant. For example, if we have a sample consisting of n training examples, x (1), x (2), ..., x (n), the order in which we use the data for training our machine learning algorithm does not matter. An example of this scenario would be the Iris dataset that we worked with previously. In the Iris dataset, each flower has been measured independently, and the measurements of one flower do not influence the measurements of another flower. However, this assumption is not valid when we deal with sequences\u2014by definition, order matters. Predicting the market value of a particular stock would be an example of this scenario. For instance, assume we have a sample of n training examples, where each training example represents the market value of a certain stock on a particular day. If our task is to predict the stock market value for the next three days, it would make sense to consider the previous stock prices in a date-sorted order to derive trends rather than utilize these training examples in a randomized order. Sequential data versus time series data Time series data is a special type of sequential data where each example is associated with a dimen- sion for time. In time series data, samples are taken at successive timestamps, and therefore, the time dimension determines the order among the data points. For example, stock prices and voice or speech records are time series data. On the other hand, not all sequential data has the time dimension. For example, in text data or DNA sequences, the examples are ordered, but text or DNA does not qualify as time series data. As you will see, in this chapter, we will focus on examples of natural language processing (NLP) and text modeling that are not time series data. However, note that RNNs can also be used for time series data, which is beyond the scope of this book. Representing sequences We\u2019ve established that order among data points is important in sequential data, so we next need to find a way to leverage this ordering information in a machine learning model. Throughout this chapter, we will represent sequences as \u3008\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(1), \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(2), \u2026 , \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)\u3009 . The superscript indices indicate the order of the instances, and the length of the sequence is T. For a sensible example of sequences, consider time series data, where each example point, x (t), belongs to a particular time, t. Figure 15.1 shows an example of time series data where both the input features (x\u2019s) and the target labels (y\u2019s) naturally follow the order according to their time axis; therefore, both the x\u2019s and y\u2019s are sequences.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 529, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We can say that such models do not have a memory of previously seen training examples. For instance, the samples are passed through the feedforward and backpropagation steps, and the weights are updated independently of the order in which the training examples are processed. RNNs, by contrast, are designed for modeling sequences and are capable of remembering past informa- tion and processing new events accordingly, which is a clear advantage when working with sequence data. The different categories of sequence modeling Sequence modeling has many fascinating applications, such as language translation (for example, translating text from English to German), image captioning, and text generation. However, in order to choose an appropriate architecture and approach, we have to understand and be able to distinguish between these different sequence modeling tasks.

If neither the input nor output data represent sequences, then we are dealing with standard data, and we could simply use a multilayer perceptron (or another clas- sification model previously covered in this book) to model such data. However, if either the input or output is a sequence, the modeling task likely falls into one of these categories: \u2022 Many-to-one: The input data is a sequence, but the output is a fixed-size vector or scalar, not a sequence. For example, in sentiment analysis, the input is text-based (for example, a movie review) and the output is a class label (for example, a label denoting whether a reviewer liked the movie). \u2022 One-to-many: The input data is in standard format and not a sequence, but the output is a sequence. An example of this category is image captioning\u2014the input is an image and the output is an English phrase summarizing the content of that image. \u2022 Many-to-many: Both the input and output arrays are sequences. This category can be further divided based on whether the input and output are synchronized. An example of a synchronized many-to-many modeling task is video classification, where each frame in a video is labeled. An example of a delayed many-to-many modeling task would be translating one language into another. For instance, an entire English sentence must be read and processed by a machine before its translation into German is produced. Now, after summarizing the three broad categories of sequence modeling, we can move forward to discussing the structure of an RNN. RNNs for modeling sequences In this section, before we start implementing RNNs in PyTorch, we will discuss the main concepts of RNNs. We will begin by looking at the typical structure of an RNN, which includes a recursive com- ponent to model sequence data. Then, we will examine how the neuron activations are computed in a typical RNN. This will create a context for us to discuss the common challenges in training RNNs, and we will then discuss solutions to these challenges, such as LSTM and gated recurrent units (GRUs). Understanding the dataflow in RNNs Let\u2019s start with the architecture of an RNN.

In this representation, the units are not displayed, but we assume that the input layer (x), hidden layer (h), and output layer (o) are vectors that contain many units. In a standard feedforward network, information flows from the input to the hidden layer, and then from the hidden layer to the output layer. On the other hand, in an RNN, the hidden layer receives its input from both the input layer of the current time step and the hidden layer from the previous time step. The flow of information in adjacent time steps in the hidden layer allows the network to have a mem- ory of past events. This flow of information is usually displayed as a loop, also known as a recurrent edge in graph notation, which is how this general RNN architecture got its name. Similar to multilayer perceptrons, RNNs can consist of multiple hidden layers. Note that it\u2019s a common convention to refer to RNNs with one hidden layer as a single-layer RNN, which is not to be confused with single-layer NNs without a hidden layer, such as Adaline or logistic regression. Figure 15.4 illus- trates an RNN with one hidden layer (top) and an RNN with two hidden layers (bottom): Figure 15.4: Examples of an RNN with one and two hidden layers Determining the type of output from an RNN This generic RNN architecture could correspond to the two sequence modeling catego- ries where the input is a sequence. Typically, a recurrent layer can return a sequence as output, \u3008\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90(0), \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90(1), \u2026 , \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)\u3009, or simply return the last output (at t = T, that is, o (T)). Thus, it could be either many-to-many, or it could be many-to-one if, for example, we only use the last element, o (T), as the final output. We will see later how this is handled in the PyTorch torch.nn module, when we take a de- tailed look at the behavior of a recurrent layer with respect to returning a sequence as output.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 532, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As we know, each hidden unit in a standard NN receives only one input\u2014the net preactivation as- sociated with the input layer. In contrast, each hidden unit in an RNN receives two distinct sets of input\u2014the preactivation from the input layer and the activation of the same hidden layer from the previous time step, t \u2013 1. At the first time step, t = 0, the hidden units are initialized to zeros or small random values. Then, at a time step where t > 0, the hidden units receive their input from the data point at the current time, x (t), and the previous values of hidden units at t \u2013 1, indicated as h (t\u20131). Similarly, in the case of a multilayer RNN, we can summarize the information flow as follows: \u2022 layer = 1: Here, the hidden layer is represented as \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc891 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) and it receives its input from the data point, x (t), and the hidden values in the same layer, but at the previous time step, \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc891 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61). \u2022 layer = 2: The second hidden layer, \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc892 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61), receives its inputs from the outputs of the layer below at the current time step (\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc901 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)) and its own hidden values from the previous time step, \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc892 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61). Since, in this case, each recurrent layer must receive a sequence as input, all the recurrent layers except the last one must return a sequence as output (that is, we will later have to set return_sequences=True). The behavior of the last recurrent layer depends on the type of problem. Computing activations in an RNN Now that you understand the structure and general flow of information in an RNN, let\u2019s get more spe- cific and compute the actual activations of the hidden layers, as well as the output layer. For simplicity, we will consider just a single hidden layer; however, the same concept applies to multilayer RNNs. Each directed edge (the connections between boxes) in the representation of an RNN that we just looked at is associated with a weight matrix. Those weights do not depend on time, t; therefore, they are shared across the time axis. The different weight matrices in a single-layer RNN are as follows: \u2022 Wxh: The weight matrix between the input, x (t), and the hidden layer, h \u2022 Whh: The weight matrix associated with the recurrent edge \u2022 Who: The weight matrix between the hidden layer and output layer These weight matrices are depicted in Figure 15.5: Figure 15.5: Applying weights to a single-layer RNN", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 533, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Later in this section, we will make use of this notation as well. Computing the activations is very similar to standard multilayer perceptrons and other types of feed- forward NNs. For the hidden layer, the net input, zh (preactivation), is computed through a linear combination; that is, we compute the sum of the multiplications of the weight matrices with the corresponding vectors and add the bias unit: \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\u210e (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\u210e\u210e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc89(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\u210e Then, the activations of the hidden units at the time step, t, are calculated as follows: \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc89(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\u210e(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\u210e (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)) = \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\u210e(\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\u210e\u210e\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc89(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\u210e) Here, bh is the bias vector for the hidden units and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e is the activation function of the hidden layer.

How- ever, note that there is an alternative model in which the recurrent connection comes from the output layer.

If you are interested and would like to investigate this in more detail, read On the difficulty of training recurrent neural networks by R. Pascanu, T. Mikolov, and Y. Bengio, 2012 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.5063.pdf). In practice, there are at least three solutions to this problem: \u2022 Gradient clipping \u2022 Truncated backpropagation through time (TBPTT) \u2022 LSTM Using gradient clipping, we specify a cut-off or threshold value for the gradients, and we assign this cut-off value to gradient values that exceed this value. In contrast, TBPTT simply limits the number of time steps that the signal can backpropagate after each forward pass. For example, even if the sequence has 100 elements or steps, we may only backpropagate the most recent 20 time steps. While both gradient clipping and TBPTT can solve the exploding gradient problem, the truncation limits the number of steps that the gradient can effectively flow back and properly update the weights. On the other hand, LSTM, designed in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, has been more successful in vanishing and exploding gradient problems while modeling long-range dependencies through the use of memory cells.

Hochreiter and J. Schmidhuber, Neural Computation, 9(8): 1735-1780, 1997). The building block of an LSTM is a memory cell, which essentially represents or replaces the hidden layer of standard RNNs. In each memory cell, there is a recurrent edge that has the desirable weight, w = 1, as we discussed, to overcome the vanishing and exploding gradient problems. The values associated with this recurrent edge are collectively called the cell state. The unfolded structure of a modern LSTM cell is shown in Figure 15.9: Figure 15.9: The structure of an LSTM cell Notice that the cell state from the previous time step, C (t\u20131), is modified to get the cell state at the cur- rent time step, C (t), without being multiplied directly by any weight factor. The flow of information in this memory cell is controlled by several computation units (often called gates) that will be described here. In the figure, \u2a00 refers to the element-wise product (element-wise multiplication) and \u2a01 means element-wise summation (element-wise addition). Furthermore, x (t) refers to the input data at time t, and h (t\u20131) indicates the hidden units at time t \u2013 1. Four boxes are indicated with an activation function, either the sigmoid function (\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e ) or tanh, and a set of weights; these boxes apply a linear combination by performing matrix-vector multiplications on their inputs (which are h (t\u20131) and x (t)). These units of com- putation with sigmoid activation functions, whose output units are passed through \u2a00, are called gates. In an LSTM cell, there are three different types of gates, which are known as the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate: The forget gate (ft) allows the memory cell to reset the cell state without growing indefinitely. In fact, the forget gate decides which information is allowed to go through and which information to suppress. Now, ft is computed as follows: \ud835\udc87\ud835\udc87\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\u210e\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc89(\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc83\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 540, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, the good news is that PyTorch has already implemented everything in optimized wrapper functions, which allows us to define our LSTM cells easily and efficiently. We will apply RNNs and LSTMs to real-world datasets later in this chapter. Other advanced RNN models LSTMs provide a basic approach for modeling long-range dependencies in sequences. Yet, it is important to note that there are many variations of LSTMs described in literature (An Empirical Exploration of Recurrent Network Architectures by Rafal Jozefowicz, Wojciech Zaremba, and Ilya Sutskever, Proceedings of ICML, 2342-2350, 2015). Also worth noting is a more recent approach, gated recurrent unit (GRU), which was proposed in 2014. GRUs have a simpler architecture than LSTMs; therefore, they are computationally more efficient, while their performance in some tasks, such as polyphonic music modeling, is comparable to LSTMs. If you are interested in learning more about these modern RNN architectures, refer to the paper, Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling by Junyoung Chung and others, 2014 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.3555v1.pdf).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 541, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Language modeling These two projects, which we will walk through together in the following pages, are both fascinating but also quite involved. Thus, instead of providing the code all at once, we will break the implementation up into several steps and discuss the code in detail. If you like to have a big picture overview and want to see all the code at once before diving into the discussion, take a look at the code implementation first. Project one \u2013 predicting the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews You may recall from Chapter 8, Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis, that sentiment analysis is concerned with analyzing the expressed opinion of a sentence or a text document. In this section and the following subsections, we will implement a multilayer RNN for sentiment analysis using a many-to-one architecture. In the next section, we will implement a many-to-many RNN for an application of language modeling. While the chosen examples are purposefully simple to introduce the main concepts of RNNs, language modeling has a wide range of interesting applications, such as building chatbots\u2014giving computers the ability to directly talk and interact with humans. Preparing the movie review data In Chapter 8, we preprocessed and cleaned the review dataset. And we will do the same now. First, we will import the necessary modules and read the data from torchtext (which we will install via pip install torchtext; version 0.10.0 was used as of late 2021) as follows: >>> from torchtext.datasets import IMDB >>> train_dataset = IMDB(split='train') >>> test_dataset = IMDB(split='test') Each set has 25,000 samples. And each sample of the datasets consists of two elements, the sentiment label representing the target label we want to predict (neg refers to negative sentiment and pos refers to positive sentiment), and the movie review text (the input features). The text component of these movie reviews is sequences of words, and the RNN model classifies each sequence as a positive (1) or negative (0) review.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 542, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Split the training dataset into separate training and validation partitions. 2. Identify the unique words in the training dataset 3. Map each unique word to a unique integer and encode the review text into encoded integers (an index of each unique word) 4. Divide the dataset into mini-batches as input to the model Let\u2019s proceed with the first step: creating a training and validation partition from the train_dataset we read earlier: >>> ## Step 1: create the datasets >>> from torch.utils.data.dataset import random_split >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> train_dataset, valid_dataset = random_split( ... list(train_dataset), [20000, 5000]) The original training dataset contains 25,000 examples. 20,000 examples are randomly chosen for training, and 5,000 for validation. To prepare the data for input to an NN, we need to encode it into numeric values, as was mentioned in steps 2 and 3. To do this, we will first find the unique words (tokens) in the training dataset. While finding unique tokens is a process for which we can use Python datasets, it can be more efficient to use the Counter class from the collections package, which is part of Python\u2019s standard library. In the following code, we will instantiate a new Counter object (token_counts) that will collect the unique word frequencies. Note that in this particular application (and in contrast to the bag-of-words model), we are only interested in the set of unique words and won\u2019t require the word counts, which are created as a side product. To split the text into words (or tokens), we will reuse the tokenizer function we developed in Chapter 8, which also removes HTML markups as well as punctuation and other non-letter characters: The code for collecting unique tokens is as follows: >>> ## Step 2: find unique tokens (words) >>> import re >>> from collections import Counter, OrderedDict >>> >>> def tokenizer(text): ... text = re.sub('<[^>]*>', '', text) ... emoticons = re.findall( ...

Next, we are going to map each unique word to a unique integer. This can be done manually using a Python dictionary, where the keys are the unique tokens (words) and the value associated with each key is a unique integer. However, the torchtext package already provides a class, Vocab, which we can use to create such a mapping and encode the entire dataset. First, we will create a vocab object by passing the ordered dictionary mapping tokens to their corresponding occurrence frequencies (the ordered dictionary is the sorted token_counts). Second, we will prepend two special tokens to the vocabulary \u2013 the padding and the unknown token: >>> ## Step 3: encoding each unique token into integers >>> from torchtext.vocab import vocab >>> sorted_by_freq_tuples = sorted( ... token_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True ... ) >>> ordered_dict = OrderedDict(sorted_by_freq_tuples) >>> vocab = vocab(ordered_dict) >>> vocab.insert_token(\"<pad>\", 0) >>> vocab.insert_token(\"<unk>\", 1) >>> vocab.set_default_index(1) To demonstrate how to use the vocab object, we will convert an example input text into a list of integer values: >>> print([vocab[token] for token in ['this', 'is', ... 'an', 'example']]) [11, 7, 35, 457] Note that there might be some tokens in the validation or testing data that are not present in the training data and are thus not included in the mapping. If we have q tokens (that is, the size of token_counts passed to Vocab, which in this case is 69,023), then all tokens that haven\u2019t been seen before, and are thus not included in token_counts, will be assigned the integer 1 (a placeholder for the unknown to- ken). In other words, the index 1 is reserved for unknown words. Another reserved value is the integer 0, which serves as a placeholder, a so-called padding token, for adjusting the sequence length. Later, when we are building an RNN model in PyTorch, we will consider this placeholder, 0, in more detail.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 544, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In the next subsection, however, we will first discuss feature embedding, which is an optional but highly recommended preprocessing step that is used to reduce the dimensionality of the word vectors. Embedding layers for sentence encoding During the data preparation in the previous step, we generated sequences of the same length. The elements of these sequences were integer numbers that corresponded to the indices of unique words. These word indices can be converted into input features in several different ways. One naive way is to apply one-hot encoding to convert the indices into vectors of zeros and ones. Then, each word will be mapped to a vector whose size is the number of unique words in the entire dataset. Given that the number of unique words (the size of the vocabulary) can be in the order of 10 4 \u2013 10 5, which will also be the number of our input features, a model trained on such features may suffer from the curse of dimensionality.

(In theory, we can extract infinite real numbers from a given interval, for example [\u20131, 1].) This is the idea behind embedding, which is a feature-learning technique that we can utilize here to automatically learn the salient features to represent the words in our dataset. Given the number of unique words, nwords, we can select the size of the embedding vectors (a.k.a., embedding dimension) to be much smaller than the number of unique words (embedding_dim << nwords) to represent the entire vocabulary as input features.

The output will have the dimensionality batchsize \u00d7 input_length \u00d7 embedding_dim, where em- bedding_dim is the size of the embedding features (here, set to 3). The other argument provided to the embedding layer, num_embeddings, corresponds to the unique integer values that the model will receive as input (for instance, n + 2, set here to 10). Therefore, the embedding matrix in this case has the size 10\u00d76. padding_idx indicates the token index for padding (here, 0), which, if specified, will not contribute to the gradient updates during training. In our example, the length of the original sequence of the second sample is 3, and we padded it with 1 more element 0. The embedding output of the padded element is [0, 0, 0].", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 548, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The resulting hidden states of these forward and backward passes are usually concatenated into a single hidden state. Other merge modes include summation, multiplication (multiplying the results of the two passes), and averaging (taking the average of the two). We can also try other types of recurrent layers, such as the regular RNN. However, as it turns out, a model built with regular recurrent layers won\u2019t be able to reach a good predictive performance (even on the training data). For example, if you try replacing the bidirectional LSTM layer in the previous code with a unidirectional nn.RNN (instead of nn.LSTM) layer and train the model on full-length sequences, you may observe that the loss will not even decrease during training. The reason is that the sequences in this dataset are too long, so a model with an RNN layer cannot learn the long-term dependencies and may suffer from vanishing or exploding gradient problems. Project two \u2013 character-level language modeling in PyTorch Language modeling is a fascinating application that enables machines to perform human language-re- lated tasks, such as generating English sentences. One of the interesting studies in this area is Gen- erating Text with Recurrent Neural Networks by Ilya Sutskever, James Martens, and Geoffrey E. Hinton, Proceedings of the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML-11), 2011 (https://pdfs. semanticscholar.org/93c2/0e38c85b69fc2d2eb314b3c1217913f7db11.pdf). In the model that we will build now, the input is a text document, and our goal is to develop a model that can generate new text that is similar in style to the input document. Examples of such input are a book or a computer program in a specific programming language. In character-level language modeling, the input is broken down into a sequence of characters that are fed into our network one character at a time. The network will process each new character in conjunction with the memory of the previously seen characters to predict the next one.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 554, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, most NN libraries and RNN implementations cannot deal with input data in string format, which is why we have to convert the text into a numeric format. To do this, we will create a simple Python dictionary that maps each character to an integer, char2int. We will also need a reverse mapping to convert the results of our model back to text. Although the reverse can be done using a dictionary that associates integer keys with character values, using a NumPy array and indexing the array to map indices to those unique characters is more efficient.

This means that the input tensor, x, consists of 40 tokens. In practice, the sequence length impacts the quality of the generated text. Longer sequences can result in more meaningful sentences. For shorter sequences, however, the model might focus on capturing individual words correctly, while ignoring the context for the most part. Although longer sequences usually result in more meaningful sentences, as men- tioned, for long sequences, the RNN model will have problems capturing long-range dependencies. Thus, in practice, finding a sweet spot and good value for the sequence length is a hyperparameter optimization problem, which we have to evaluate empirically. Here, we are going to choose 40, as it offers a good trade-off. As you can see in the previous figure, the inputs, x, and targets, y, are offset by one character.

In the next section, we will define a function to evaluate the trained model. Evaluation phase \u2013 generating new text passages The RNN model we trained in the previous section returns the logits of size 80 for each unique char- acter. These logits can be readily converted to probabilities, via the softmax function, that a particular character will be encountered as the next character. To predict the next character in the sequence, we can simply select the element with the maximum logit value, which is equivalent to selecting the char- acter with the highest probability. However, instead of always selecting the character with the highest likelihood, we want to (randomly) sample from the outputs; otherwise, the model will always produce the same text. PyTorch already provides a class, torch.distributions.categorical.Categorical, which we can use to draw random samples from a categorical distribution. To see how this works, let\u2019s generate some random samples from three categories [0, 1, 2], with input logits [1, 1, 1]: >>> from torch.distributions.categorical import Categorical >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0, 1.0]]) >>> print('Probabilities:', ... nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]) Probabilities: [0.33333334 0.33333334 0.33333334] >>> m = Categorical(logits=logits) >>> samples = m.sample((10,)) >>> print(samples.numpy()) [[0] [0] [0] [0] [1] [0] [1] [2] [1] [1]]", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 562, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Therefore, if we use a large sample size (num_samples \u2192 \u221e), we would expect the number of occurrences of each category to reach \u2248 1/3 of the sample size. If we change the logits to [1, 1, 3], then we would expect to observe more occurrences for category 2 (when a very large number of examples are drawn from this distribution): >>> torch.manual_seed(1) >>> logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0, 3.0]]) >>> print('Probabilities:', nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]) Probabilities: [0.10650698 0.10650698 0.78698605] >>> m = Categorical(logits=logits) >>> samples = m.sample((10,)) >>> print(samples.numpy()) [[0] [2] [2] [1] [2] [1] [2] [2] [2] [2]] Using Categorical, we can generate examples based on the logits computed by our model. We will define a function, sample(), that receives a short starting string, starting_str, and generate a new string, generated_str, which is initially set to the input string. starting_str is encoded to a sequence of integers, encoded_input. encoded_input is passed to the RNN model one character at a time to update the hidden states. The last character of encoded_input is passed to the model to generate a new character. Note that the output of the RNN model represents the logits (here, a vector of size 80, which is the total number of possible characters) for the next character after observing the input sequence by the model. Here, we only use the logits output (that is, o (T)), which is passed to the Categorical class to generate a new sample. This new sample is converted to a character, which is then appended to the end of the generated string, generated_text, increasing its length by 1. Then, this process is repeated until the length of the generated string reaches the desired value. The process of consuming the generated sequence as input for generating new elements is called autoregression.

You can further tune the training parameters, such as the length of input sequences for training, and the model architecture. Furthermore, to control the predictability of the generated samples (that is, generating text following the learned patterns from the training text versus adding more randomness), the logits computed by the RNN model can be scaled before being passed to Categorical for sampling. The scaling factor, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc, can be interpreted as an analog to the temperature in physics. Higher temperatures result in more entropy or randomness versus more predictable behavior at lower temperatures. By scaling the logits with \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc, the probabilities computed by the softmax function become more uniform, as shown in the following code: >>> logits = torch.tensor([[1.0, 1.0, 3.0]]) >>> print('Probabilities before scaling: ', ... nn.functional.softmax(logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]) >>> print('Probabilities after scaling with 0.5:', ... nn.functional.softmax(0.5*logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]) >>> print('Probabilities after scaling with 0.1:', ... nn.functional.softmax(0.1*logits, dim=1).numpy()[0]) Probabilities before scaling: [0.10650698 0.10650698 0.78698604] Probabilities after scaling with 0.5: [0.21194156 0.21194156 0.57611688] Probabilities after scaling with 0.1: [0.31042377 0.31042377 0.37915245] As you can see, scaling the logits by \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc results in near-uniform probabilities [0.31, 0.31, 0.38].

Summary In this chapter, you first learned about the properties of sequences that make them different from other types of data, such as structured data or images. We then covered the foundations of RNNs for sequence modeling. You learned how a basic RNN model works and discussed its limitations with regard to capturing long-term dependencies in sequence data.

Note that this section provides a historical perspective explaining why the attention mechanism was developed. If individual mathematical details appear complicated, you can feel free to skip over them as they are not needed for the next section, explaining the self-at- tention mechanism for transformers, which is the focus of this chapter. Attention helps RNNs with accessing information To understand the development of an attention mechanism, consider the traditional RNN model for a seq2seq task like language translation, which parses the entire input sequence (for instance, one or more sentences) before producing the translation, as shown in Figure 16.1: Figure 16.1: A traditional RNN encoder-decoder architecture for a seq2seq modeling task", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 569, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

This is motivat- ed by the fact that translating a sentence word by word would likely result in grammatical errors, as illustrated in Figure 16.2: Figure 16.2: Translating a sentence word by word can lead to grammatical errors However, as illustrated in Figure 16.2, one limitation of this seq2seq approach is that the RNN is trying to remember the entire input sequence via one single hidden unit before translating it. Compressing all the information into one hidden unit may cause loss of information, especially for long sequences. Thus, similar to how humans translate sentences, it may be beneficial to have access to the whole input sequence at each time step. In contrast to a regular RNN, an attention mechanism lets the RNN access all input elements at each given time step. However, having access to all input sequence elements at each time step can be overwhelming. So, to help the RNN focus on the most relevant elements of the input sequence, the attention mechanism assigns different attention weights to each input element. These attention weights designate how important or relevant a given input sequence element is at a given time step. For example, revisiting Figure 16.2, the words \u201cmir, helfen, zu\u201d may be more relevant for producing the output word \u201chelp\u201d than the words \u201ckannst, du, Satz.\u201d The next subsection introduces an RNN architecture that was outfitted with an attention mechanism to help process long sequences for language translation.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 570, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

You can think of a context vector as an augmented version of the input vector, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56). In other words, the \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 input vector also incorporates information from all other input elements via an attention mechanism. As we can see in Figure 16.3, RNN #2 then uses this context vector, prepared by RNN #1, to generate the outputs. In the remainder of this subsection, we will discuss how RNN #1 works, and we will revisit RNN #2 in the next subsection. The bidirectional RNN #1 processes the input sequence x in the regular forward direction (1. . . \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 ) as well as backward (\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47). Parsing a sequence in the backward direction has the same effect as revers- ing the original input sequence\u2014think of reading a sentence in reverse order. The rationale behind this is to capture additional information since current inputs may have a dependence on sequence elements that came either before or after it in a sentence, or both. Consequently, from reading the input sequence twice (that is, forward and backward), we have two hidden states for each input sequence element. For instance, for the second input sequence element \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65(2), we obtain the hidden state \u210e\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 (2)from the forward pass and the hidden state \u210e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 (2) from the backward pass. These two hidden states are then concatenated to form the hidden state \u210e(2). For example, if both \u210e\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39 (2) and \u210e\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc35 (2) are 128-dimensional vectors, the concatenated hidden state \u210e(2) will consist of 256 elements. We can consider this concatenated hidden state as the \u201cannotation\u201d of the source word since it contains the information of the jth word in both directions. In the next section, we will see how these concatenated hidden states are further processed and used by the second RNN to generate the outputs. Generating outputs from context vectors In Figure 16.3, we can consider RNN #2 as the main RNN that is generating the outputs. In addition to the hidden states, it receives so-called context vectors as input. A context vector \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is a weighted version of the concatenated hidden states, \u210e(1) \u2026 \u210e(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47), which we obtained from RNN #1 in the previous subsection. We can compute the context vector of the ith input as a weighted sum: \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \u2211\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u210e(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 Here, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 represents the attention weights over the input sequence \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 in the context of the ith input sequence element. Note that each ith input sequence element has a unique set of attention weights. We will discuss the computation of the attention weights \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 in the next subsection. For the remainder of this subsection, let us discuss how the context vectors are used via the second RNN in the preceding figure (RNN #2). Just like a vanilla (regular) RNN, RNN #2 also uses hidden states. Considering the hidden layer between the aforementioned \u201cannotation\u201d and final output, let us denote the hidden state at time \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 as \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56. Now, RNN #2 receives the aforementioned context vector \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 at each time step i as input.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 572, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

To summarize what we have just discussed above, the attention-based RNN consists of two RNNs. RNN #1 prepares context vectors from the input sequence elements, and RNN #2 receives the context vectors as input. The context vectors are computed via a weighted sum over the inputs, where the weights are the attention weights \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56. The next subsection discusses how we compute these attention weights. Computing the attention weights Finally, let us visit the last missing piece in our puzzle\u2014attention weights. Because these weights pairwise connect the inputs (annotations) and the outputs (contexts), each attention weight \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 has two subscripts: j refers to the index position of the input and i corresponds to the output index posi- tion. The attention weight \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is a normalized version of the alignment score \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, where the alignment score evaluates how well the input around position j matches with the output at position i. To be more specific, the attention weight is computed by normalizing the alignment scores as follows: \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= exp(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2211 exp(\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 Note that this equation is similar to the softmax function, which we discussed in Chapter 12, Paral- lelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, in the section Estimating class probabilities in multiclass classification via the softmax function. Consequently, the attention weights \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56...\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 sum up to 1. Now, to summarize, we can structure the attention-based RNN model into three parts. The first part computes bidirectional annotations of the input. The second part consists of the recurrent block, which is very much like the original RNN, except that it uses context vectors instead of the original input. The last part concerns the computation of the attention weights and context vectors, which describe the relationship between each pair of input and output elements. The transformer architecture also utilizes an attention mechanism, but unlike the attention-based RNN, it solely relies on the self-attention mechanism and does not include the recurrent process found in the RNN. In other words, a transformer model processes the whole input sequence all at once instead of reading and processing the sequence one element at a time. In the next section, we will introduce a basic form of the self-attention mechanism before we discuss the transformer architecture in more detail in the following section. Introducing the self-attention mechanism In the previous section, we saw that attention mechanisms can help RNNs with remembering context when working with long sequences. As we will see in the next section, we can have an architecture entirely based on attention, without the recurrent parts of an RNN. This attention-based architecture is known as transformer, and we will discuss it in more detail later.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 573, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

So, before we discuss transformers in the next section, let us dive into the self-attention mechanism used in transformers. In fact, as we will see, this self-attention mechanism is just a different flavor of the attention mechanism that we discussed in the previous section. We can think of the previously discussed attention mechanism as an operation that connects two different modules, that is, the encoder and decoder of the RNN. As we will see, self-attention focuses only on the input and captures only dependencies between the input elements. without connecting two modules. In the first subsection, we will introduce a basic form of self-attention without any learning param- eters, which is very much like a pre-processing step to the input. Then in the second subsection, we will introduce the common version of self-attention that is used in the transformer architecture and involves learnable parameters. Starting with a basic form of self-attention To introduce self-attention, let\u2019s assume we have an input sequence of length T, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(1), \u2026 , \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47), as well as an output sequence, \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(1), \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(2), \u2026 , \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47). To avoid confusion, we will use \ud835\udc90\ud835\udc90 as the final output of the whole transformer model and \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b as the output of the self-attention layer because it is an intermediate step in the model. Each ith element in these sequences, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) and \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), are vectors of size d (that is, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \u2208\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 ) representing the feature information for the input at position i, which is similar to RNNs. Then, for a seq2seq task, the goal of self-attention is to model the dependencies of the current input element to all other input elements. To achieve this, self-attention mechanisms are composed of three stages. First, we derive importance weights based on the similarity between the current element and all other elements in the sequence. Second, we normalize the weights, which usually involves the use of the already famil- iar softmax function. Third, we use these weights in combination with the corresponding sequence elements to compute the attention value. More formally, the output of self-attention, \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), is the weighted sum of all T input sequences, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57) (where \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 ). For instance, for the ith input element, the corresponding output value is computed as follows: \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = \u2211\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57) \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 Hence, we can think of \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) as a context-aware embedding vector in input vector \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) that involves all other input sequence elements weighted by their respective attention weights. Here, the attention weights, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, are computed based on the similarity between the current input element, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), and all other elements in the input sequence, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(1). . . \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47). More concretely, this similarity is computed in two steps explained in the next paragraphs. First, we compute the dot product between the current input element, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), and another element in the input sequence, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57): \u03c9\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\u22a4\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 574, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Here, let\u2019s assume we have an input sentence \u201ccan you help me to translate this sentence\u201d that has already been mapped to an integer representation via a dictionary as explained in Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks: >>> import torch >>> sentence = torch.tensor( >>> [0, # can >>> 7, # you >>> 1, # help >>> 2, # me >>> 5, # to >>> 6, # translate >>> 4, # this >>> 3] # sentence >>> ) >>> sentence tensor([0, 7, 1, 2, 5, 6, 4, 3]) Let\u2019s also assume that we already encoded this sentence into a real-number vector representation via an embedding layer.

For instance, if we are processing the ith input word, the ith row of this matrix contains the corresponding attention weights for all words in the sentence. These attention weights indicate how relevant each word is to the ith word. Hence, the columns in this attention matrix should sum to 1, which we can confirm via the following code: >>> attention_weights.sum(dim=1) tensor([1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000, 1.0000]) Now that we have seen how to compute the attention weights, let us recap and summarize the three main steps behind the self-attention operation: 1. For a given input element, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56), and each jth element in the set {1, ..., T}, compute the dot product, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56)\u22a4\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57) 2.

This section implemented a basic form of self-attention, and in the next section, we will modify this implementation using learnable parameter matrices that can be optimized during neural network training. Parameterizing the self-attention mechanism: scaled dot-product attention Now that you have been introduced to the basic concept behind self-attention, this subsection sum- marizes the more advanced self-attention mechanism called scaled dot-product attention that is used in the transformer architecture. Note that in the previous subsection, we did not involve any learnable parameters when computing the outputs. In other words, using the previously introduced basic self-attention mechanism, the transformer model is rather limited regarding how it can update or change the attention values during model optimization for a given sequence. To make the self-at- tention mechanism more flexible and amenable to model optimization, we will introduce three ad- ditional weight matrices that can be fit as model parameters during model training.

In the next section, we will learn about the transformer architecture, a neural network architecture centered around the self-attention mechanism introduced in this section. Attention is all we need: introducing the original transformer architecture Interestingly, the original transformer architecture is based on an attention mechanism that was first used in an RNN. Originally, the intention behind using an attention mechanism was to improve the text generation capabilities of RNNs when working with long sentences. However, only a few years after ex- perimenting with attention mechanisms for RNNs, researchers found that an attention-based language model was even more powerful when the recurrent layers were deleted. This led to the development of the transformer architecture, which is the main topic of this chapter and the remaining sections. The transformer architecture was first proposed in the NeurIPS 2017 paper Attention Is All You Need by A. Vaswani and colleagues (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). Thanks to the self-attention mechanism, a transformer model can capture long-range dependencies among the elements in an input sequence\u2014in an NLP context; for example, this helps the model better \u201cunderstand\u201d the mean- ing of an input sentence.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 581, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The encoder receives the original sequential input and encodes the embeddings using a multi-head self-attention module. The decoder takes in the processed input and outputs the resulting sequence (for instance, the translated sentence) using a masked form of self-attention. Encoding context embeddings via multi-head attention The overall goal of the encoder block is to take in a sequential input \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(1), \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(2), \u2026 , \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)) and map it into a continuous representation \ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81\ud835\udc81(1), \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(2), \u2026 , \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)) that is then passed on to the decoder. The encoder is a stack of six identical layers. Six is not a magic number here but merely a hyperparam- eter choice made in the original transformer paper. You can adjust the number of layers according to the model performance. Inside each of these identical layers, there are two sublayers: one computes the multi-head self-attention, which we will discuss below, and the other one is a fully connected layer, which you have already encountered in previous chapters. Let\u2019s first talk about the multi-head self-attention, which is a simple modification of scaled dot-product attention covered earlier in this chapter. In the scaled dot-product attention, we used three matrices (corresponding to query, value, and key) to transform the input sequence. In the context of multi-head attention, we can think of this set of three matrices as one attention head. As indicated by its name, in multi-head attention, we now have multiple of such heads (sets of query, value, and key matrices) similar to how convolutional neural networks can have multiple kernels. To explain the concept of multi-head self-attention with \u210e heads in more detail, let\u2019s break it down into the following steps. First, we read in the sequential input \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(1), \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(2), \u2026 , \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47)). Suppose each element is embedded by a vector of length d. Here, the input can be embedded into a \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 matrix. Then, we create \u210e sets of the query, key, and value learning parameter matrices: \u2022 \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc921, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8c1, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc971 \u2022 \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc922, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8c2, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc972 \u2022 ... \u2022 \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc92\u210e, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8c\u210e, \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc97\u210e Because we are using these weight matrices to project each element \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) for the required dimen- sion-matching in the matrix multiplications, both \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc92\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 have the shape \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\u00d7 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 , and \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 has the shape \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\u00d7 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51.

After initializing the projection matrices, we can compute the projected sequences similar to how it\u2019s done in scaled dot-product attention. Now, instead of computing one set of query, key, and value sequences, we need to compute h sets of them.

Splitting data across multiple attention heads In practice, rather than having a separate matrix for each attention head, transformer implementations use a single matrix for all attention heads. The attention heads are then organized into logically separate regions in this matrix, which can be accessed via Boolean masks.

However, remember that we need to repeat the key and value computations for all input sequence elements, not just x_2\u2014we need this to compute self-attention later. A simple and illustrative way to do this is by expanding the input sequence embeddings to size 8 as the first dimension, which is the number of attention heads. We use the .repeat() method for this: >>> stacked_inputs = embedded_sentence.T.repeat(8, 1, 1) >>> stacked_inputs.shape torch.Size([8, 16, 8]) Then, we can have a batch matrix multiplication, via torch.bmm(), with the attention heads to com- pute all keys: >>> multihead_keys = torch.bmm(multihead_U_key, stacked_inputs) >>> multihead_keys.shape torch.Size([8, 16, 8]) In this code, we now have a tensor that refers to the eight attention heads in its first dimension. The second and third dimensions refer to the embedding size and the number of words, respectively.

It works very well in practice because the multiple heads help the model to capture information from different parts of the input, which is very similar to how the multiple kernels produce multiple channels in a convolutional network, where each channel can capture different feature information. Lastly, while multi-head attention sounds computationally expensive, note that the computation can all be done in parallel because there are no dependencies between the multiple heads. Learning a language model: decoder and masked multi-head attention Similar to the encoder, the decoder also contains several repeated layers. Besides the two sublayers that we have already introduced in the previous encoder section (the multi-head self-attention layer and fully connected layer), each repeated layer also contains a masked multi-head attention sublayer. Masked attention is a variation of the original attention mechanism, where masked attention only passes a limited input sequence into the model by \u201cmasking\u201d out a certain number of words. For example, if we are building a language translation model with a labeled dataset, at sequence position i during the training procedure, we only feed in the correct output words from positions 1,\u2026,i-1. All other words (for instance, those that come after the current position) are hidden from the model to prevent the model from \u201ccheating.\u201d This is also consistent with the nature of text generation: although the true translated words are known during training, we know nothing about the ground truth in practice. Thus, we can only feed the model the solutions to what it has already generated, at position i. Figure 16.8 illustrates how the layers are arranged in the decoder block: Figure 16.8: Layer arrangement in the decoder part First, the previous output words (output embeddings) are passed into the masked multi-head atten- tion layer. Then, the second layer receives both the encoded inputs from the encoder block and the output of the masked multi-head attention layer into a multi-head attention layer. Finally, we pass the multi-head attention outputs into a fully connected layer that generates the overall model output: a probability vector corresponding to the output words.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 587, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Comparing the decoder with the encoder block, the main difference is the range of sequence elements that the model can attend to. In the encoder, for each given word, the attention is calculated across all the words in a sentence, which can be considered as a form of bidirectional input parsing. The decoder also receives the bidirectionally parsed inputs from the encoder. However, when it comes to the output sequence, the decoder only considers those elements that are preceding the current input position, which can be interpreted as a form of unidirectional input parsing. Implementation details: positional encodings and layer normalization In this subsection, we will discuss some of the implementation details of transformers that we have glanced over so far but are worth mentioning. First, let\u2019s consider the positional encodings that were part of the original transformer architecture from Figure 16.6. Positional encodings help with capturing information about the input sequence ordering and are a crucial part of transformers because both scaled dot-product attention layers and fully connected layers are permutation-invariant. This means, without positional encoding, the order of words is ignored and does not make any difference to the attention-based encodings. However, we know that word order is essential for understanding a sentence. For example, consider the following two sentences: 1. Mary gives John a flower 2. John gives Mary a flower The words occurring in the two sentences are exactly the same; the meanings, however, are very different. Transformers enable the same words at different positions to have slightly different encodings by adding a vector of small values to the input embeddings at the beginning of the encoder and decoder blocks. In particular, the original transformer architecture uses a so-called sinusoidal encoding: \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = sin(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d/100002\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58model ) \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = cos(\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d/100002\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58model ) Here \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the position of the word and k denotes the length of the encoding vector, where we choose k to have the same dimension as the input word embeddings so that the positional encoding and word embeddings can be added together. Sinusoidal functions are used to prevent positional encodings from becoming too large. For instance, if we used absolute position 1,2,3\u2026, n to be positional encodings, they would dominate the word encoding and make the word embedding values negligible.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 588, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The former will record absolute positions of words and is sensitive to word shifts in a sentence. That is to say, absolute positional encodings are fixed vectors for each given position. On the other hand, relative encodings only maintain the relative position of words and are invariant to sentence shift. Next, let\u2019s look at the layer normalization mechanism, which was first introduced by J. Ba, J.R. Kiros, and G.E. Hinton in 2016 in the same-named paper Layer Normalization (URL: https://arxiv.org/ abs/1607.06450). While batch normalization, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 17, Gen- erative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data, is a popular choice in computer vision contexts, layer normalization is the preferred choice in NLP contexts, where sentence lengths can vary. Figure 16.9 illustrates the main differences of layer and batch normalization side by side: Figure 16.9: A comparison of batch and layer normalization While layer normalization is traditionally performed across all elements in a given feature for each feature independently, the layer normalization used in transformers extends this concept and com- putes the normalization statistics across all feature values independently for each training example. Since layer normalization computes mean and standard deviation for each training example, it relaxes minibatch size constraints or dependencies. In contrast to batch normalization, layer normalization is thus capable of learning from data with small minibatch sizes and varying lengths. However, note that the original transformer architecture does not have varying-length inputs (sentences are padded when needed), and unlike RNNs, there is no recurrence in the model. So, how can we then justify the use of layer normalization over batch normalization? Transformers are usually trained on very large text corpora, which requires parallel computation; this can be challenging to achieve with batch normalization, which has a dependency between training examples. Layer normalization has no such dependency and is thus a more natural choice for transformers.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 589, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

One common theme among these transformers is that they are pre-trained on very large, unlabeled datasets and then fine-tuned for their respective target tasks. First, we will introduce the common training procedure of transformer-based models and explain how it is different from the original transformer. Then, we will focus on popular large-scale language models including Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers (BART). Pre-training and fine-tuning transformer models In an earlier section, Attention is all we need: introducing the original transformer architecture, we dis- cussed how the original transformer architecture can be used for language translation. Language translation is a supervised task and requires a labeled dataset, which can be very expensive to obtain. The lack of large, labeled datasets is a long-lasting problem in deep learning, especially for models like the transformer, which are even more data hungry than other deep learning architectures. How- ever, given that large amounts of text (books, websites, and social media posts) are generated every day, an interesting question is how we can use such unlabeled data for improving the model training. The answer to whether we can leverage unlabeled data in transformers is yes, and the trick is a process called self-supervised learning: we can generate \u201clabels\u201d from supervised learning from plain text itself. For example, given a large, unlabeled text corpus, we train the model to perform next-word prediction, which enables the model to learn the probability distribution of words and can form a strong basis for becoming a powerful language model. Self-supervised learning is traditionally also referred to as unsupervised pre-training and is essential for the success of modern transformer-based models. The \u201cunsupervised\u201d in unsupervised pre-training supposedly refers to the fact that we use unlabeled data; however, since we use the structure of the data to generate labels (for example, the next-word prediction task mentioned previously), it is still a supervised learning process. To elaborate a bit further on how unsupervised pre-training and next-word prediction works, if we have a sentence containing n words, the pre-training procedure can be decomposed into the following three steps: 1. At time step 1, feed in the ground-truth words 1, \u2026, i-1. 2. Ask the model to predict the word at position i and compare it with the ground-truth word i. 3. Update the model and time step, i:= i+1. Go back to step 1 and repeat until all words are pro- cessed. We should note that in the next iteration, we always feed the model the ground-truth (correct) words instead of what the model has generated in the previous round.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 590, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Now, there are many different types of pre-training techniques. For example, the previously mentioned next-word prediction task can be considered as a unidirectional pre-training approach. Later, we will introduce additional pre-training techniques that are utilized in different language models to achieve various functionalities. A complete training procedure of a transformer-based model consists of two parts: (1) pre-training on a large, unlabeled dataset and (2) training (that is, fine-tuning) the model for specific downstream tasks using a labeled dataset. In the first step, the pre-trained model is not designed for any specific task but rather trained as a \u201cgeneral\u201d language model. Afterward, via the second step, it can be gen- eralized to any customized task via regular supervised learning on a labeled dataset. With the representations that can be obtained from the pre-trained model, there are mainly two strat- egies for transferring and adopting a model to a specific task: (1) a feature-based approach and (2) a fine-tuning approach. (Here, we can think of these representations as the hidden layer activations of the last layers of a model.) The feature-based approach uses the pre-trained representations as additional features to a labeled dataset. This requires us to learn how to extract sentence features from the pre-trained model. An early model that is well-known for this feature extraction approach is ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) proposed by Peters and colleagues in 2018 in the paper Deep Contextualized Word Representa- tions (URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365). ELMo is a pre-trained bidirectional language model that masks words at a certain rate. In particular, it randomly masks 15 percent of the input words during pre-training, and the modeling task is to fill in these blanks, that is, predicting the missing (masked) words. This is different from the unidirectional approach we introduced previously, which hides all the future words at time step i. Bidirectional masking enables a model to learn from both ends and can thus capture more holistic information about a sentence. The pre-trained ELMo model can generate high-quality sentence representations that, later on, serve as input features for specific tasks. In other words, we can think of the feature-based approach as a model-based feature extraction technique similar to principal component analysis, which we covered in Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. The fine-tuning approach, on the other hand, updates the pre-trained model parameters in a regular supervised fashion via backpropagation. Unlike the feature-based method, we usually also add another fully connected layer to the pre-trained model, to accomplish certain tasks such as classification, and then update the whole model based on the prediction performance on the labeled training set. One popular model that follows this approach is BERT, a large-scale transformer model pre-trained as a bidirectional language model. We will discuss BERT in more detail in the following subsections. In addition, in the last section of this chapter, we will see a code example showing how to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model for sentiment classification using the movie review dataset we worked with in Chapter 8, Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis, and Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 591, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Supervised fine-tuning As Figure 16.11 (adapted from the GPT-1 paper) illustrates, we can consider GPT-1 as a transformer consisting of (1) a decoder (and without an encoder block) and (2) an additional layer that is added later for the supervised fine-tuning to accomplish specific tasks: Figure 16.11: The GPT-1 transformer In the figure, note that if our task is Text Prediction (predicting the next word), then the model is ready after the pre-training step. Otherwise, for example, if our task is related to classification or regression, then supervised fine-tuning is required. During pre-training, GPT-1 utilizes a transformer decoder structure, where, at a given word position, the model only relies on preceding words to predict the next word. GPT-1 utilizes a unidirectional self-attention mechanism, as opposed to a bidirectional one as in BERT (which we will cover later in this chapter), because GPT-1 is focused on text generation rather than classification. During text gen- eration, it produces words one by one with a natural left-to-right direction.

For classification tasks, fine-tuning is as simple as first tokenizing the input and then feeding it into the pre-trained model and the newly added linear layer, which is followed by a softmax activation function. However, for more complicated tasks such as question answering, inputs are organized in a certain format that is not necessarily matching the pre-trained model, which requires an extra processing step customized for each task. Readers who are interested in specific modifications are encouraged to read the GPT-1 paper for additional details (the link is provided in the previous table). GPT-1 also performs surprisingly well on zero-shot tasks, which proves its ability to be a general lan- guage model that can be customized for different types of tasks with minimal task-specific fine-tuning. Zero-shot learning generally describes a special circumstance in machine learning where during testing and inference, the model is required to classify samples from classes that were not observed during training. In the context of GPT, the zero-shot setting refers to unseen tasks. GPT\u2019s adaptability inspired researchers to get rid of the task-specific input and model setup, which led to the development of GPT-2. Unlike its predecessor, GPT-2 does not require any additional mod- ification during the input or fine-tuning stages anymore. Instead of rearranging sequences to match the required format, GPT-2 can distinguish between different types of inputs and perform the corre- sponding downstream tasks with minor hints, the so-called \u201ccontexts.\u201d This is achieved by modeling output probabilities conditioned on both input and task type, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5c|\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) , instead of only conditioning on the input. For example, the model is expected to recognize a translation task if the context includes translate to French, English text, French text. This sounds much more \u201cartificially intelligent\u201d than GPT and is indeed the most noticeable improve- ment besides the model size. Just as the title of its corresponding paper indicates (Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners), an unsupervised language model may be key to zero-shot learning, and GPT-2 makes full use of zero-shot task transfer to build this multi-task learner. Compared with GPT-2, GPT-3 is less \u201cambitious\u201d in the sense that it shifts the focus from zero- to one- shot and few-shot learning via in-context learning. While providing no task-specific training examples seems to be too strict, few-shot learning is not only more realistic but also more human-like: humans usually need to see a few examples to be able to learn a new task. Just as its name suggests, few-shot learning means that the model sees a few examples of the task while one-shot learning is restricted to exactly one example.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 594, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The following code illustrates how we can use GPT-2 to generate features based on an input text: >>> from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer >>> tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2') >>> text = \"Let us encode this sentence\" >>> encoded_input = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt') >>> encoded_input {'input_ids': tensor([[ 5756, 514, 37773, 428, 6827]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])} This code encoded the input sentence text into a tokenized format for the GPT-2 model. As we can see, it mapped the strings to an integer representation, and it set the attention mask to all 1s, which means that all words will be processed when we pass the encoded input to the model, as shown here: >>> from transformers import GPT2Model >>> model = GPT2Model.from_pretrained('gpt2') >>> output = model(**encoded_input) The output variable stores the last hidden state, that is, our GPT-2-based feature encoding of the input sentence: >>> output['last_hidden_state'].shape torch.Size([1, 5, 768]) To suppress the verbose output, we only showed the shape of the tensor. Its first dimension is the batch size (we only have one input text), which is followed by the sentence length and size of the feature encoding. Here, each of the five words is encoded as a 768-dimensional vector. Now, we could apply this feature encoding to a given dataset and train a downstream classifier based on the GPT-2-based feature representation instead of using a bag-of-words model as discussed in Chapter 8, Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis. Moreover, an alternative approach to using large pre-trained language models is fine-tuning, as we discussed earlier. We will be seeing a fine-tuning example later in this chapter.

Devlin, M. Chang, K. Lee, and K. Toutanova, https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). For reference, even though we cannot compare GPT and BERT directly as they are different architec- tures, BERT has 345 million parameters (which makes it only slightly larger than GPT-1, and its size is only 1/5 of GPT-2). As its name suggests, BERT has a transformer-encoder-based model structure that utilizes a bidirection- al training procedure. (Or, more accurately, we can think of BERT as using \u201cnondirectional\u201d training because it reads in all input elements all at once.) Under this setting, the encoding of a certain word depends on both the preceding and the succeeding words. Recall that in GPT, input elements are read in with a natural left-to-right order, which helps to form a powerful generative language model. Bidirectional training disables BERT\u2019s ability to generate a sentence word by word but provides input encodings of higher quality for other tasks, such as classification, since the model can now process information in both directions. Recall that in a transformer\u2019s encoder, token encoding is a summation of positional encodings and token embeddings. In the BERT encoder, there is an additional segment embedding indicating which segment this token belongs to. This means that each token representation contains three ingredients, as Figure 16.13 illustrates: Figure 16.13: Preparing the inputs for the BERT encoder Why do we need this additional segment information in BERT? The need for this segment information originated from the special pre-training task of BERT called next-sentence prediction.

Similar to all other transformer-based language models, BERT has two training stages: pre-training and fine-tuning. And pre-training includes two unsupervised tasks: masked language modeling and next-sentence prediction. In the masked language model (MLM), tokens are randomly replaced by so-called mask tokens, [MASK], and the model is required to predict these hidden words. Compared with the next-word prediction in GPT, MLM in BERT is more akin to \u201cfilling in the blanks\u201d because the model can attend to all tokens in the sentence (except the masked ones). However, simply masking words out can result in inconsis- tencies between pre-training and fine-tuning since [MASK] tokens do not appear in regular texts. To alleviate this, there are further modifications to the words that are selected for masking. For instance, 15 percent of the words in BERT are marked for masking. These 15 percent of randomly selected words are then further treated as follows: 1. Keep the word unchanged 10 percent of the time 2. Replace the original word token with a random word 10 percent of the time 3. Replace the original word token with a mask token, [MASK], 80 percent of the time Besides avoiding the aforementioned inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning when in- troducing [MASK] tokens into the training procedure, these modifications also have other benefits. Firstly, unchanged words include the possibility of maintaining the information of the original token; otherwise, the model can only learn from the context and nothing from the masked words. Secondly, the 10 percent random words prevent the model from becoming lazy, for instance, learning nothing but returning what it is being given. The probabilities for masking, randomizing, and leaving words unchanged were chosen by an ablation study (see the GPT-2 paper); for instance, authors tested dif- ferent settings and found that this combination worked best. Figure 16.14 illustrates an example where the word fox is masked and, with a certain probability, re- mains unchanged or is replaced by [MASK] or coffee. The model is then required to predict what the masked (highlighted) word is as illustrated in Figure 16.14: Figure 16.14: An example of MLM Next-sentence prediction is a natural modification of the next-word prediction task considering the bidirectional encoding of BERT. In fact, many important NLP tasks, such as question answering, depend on the relationship of two sentences in the document. This kind of relationship is hard to capture via regular language models because next-word prediction training usually occurs on a single-sentence level due to input length constraints.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 599, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The [SEP] token, on the other hand, is attached to denote the end of each sentence. The model is then required to classify whether B is the next sentence (\u201cIsNext\u201d) of A or not. To provide the model with a balanced dataset, 50 percent of the samples are labeled as \u201cIsNext\u201d while the remaining samples are labeled as \u201cNotNext.\u201d BERT is pre-trained on these two tasks, masked sentences and next-sentence prediction, at the same time. Here, the training objective of BERT is to minimize the combined loss function of both tasks. Starting from the pre-trained model, specific modifications are required for different downstream tasks in the fine-tuning stage. Each input example needs to match a certain format; for example, it should begin with a [CLS] token and be separated using [SEP] tokens if it consists of more than one sentence. Roughly speaking, BERT can be fine-tuned on four categories of tasks: (a) sentence pair classification; (b) single-sentence classification; (c) question answering; (d) single-sentence tagging. Among them, (a) and (b) are sequence-level classification tasks, which only require an additional softmax layer to be added to the output representation of the [CLS] token. (c) and (d), on the other hand, are token-level classification tasks. This means that the model passes output representations of all related tokens to the softmax layer to predict a class label for each individual token. Question answering Task (c), question answering, appears to be less often discussed compared to other popular classification tasks such as sentiment classification or speech tagging. In question answer- ing, each input example can be split into two parts, the question and the paragraph that helps to answer the question. The model is required to point out both the start and end token in the paragraph that forms a proper answer to the question. This means that the model needs to generate a tag for every single token in the paragraph, indicating whether this token is a start or end token, or neither. As a side note, it is worth mentioning that the output may contain an end token that appears before the start token, which will lead to a conflict when generating the answer.

Those two models are thus capable of performing different tasks well: GPT\u2019s specialty is generating text, whereas BERT performs better on classification tasks. BART can be viewed as a generalization of both GPT and BERT. As the title of this section suggests, BART is able to accomplish both tasks, generating and classifying text. The reason why it can handle both tasks well is that the model comes with a bidirectional encoder as well as a left-to-right autoregressive decoder.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 601, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

There are a few changes to the model size along with some minor changes such as activation function choices. However, one of the more interesting changes is that BART works with different model inputs. The original transformer model was designed for language translation so there are two inputs: the text to be translated (source sequence) for the encoder and the translation (target sequence) for the decoder. Additionally, the decoder also receives the encoded source sequence, as illustrated earlier in Figure 16.6. However, in BART, the input format was generalized such that it only uses the source sequence as input. BART can perform a wider range of tasks including language translation, where a target sequence is still required to compute the loss and fine-tune the model, but it is not necessary to feed it directly into the decoder. Now let us take a closer look at the BART\u2019s model structure. As previously mentioned, BART is com- posed of a bidirectional encoder and an autoregressive decoder. Upon receiving a training example as plain text, the input will first be \u201ccorrupted\u201d and then encoded by the encoder. These input encodings will then be passed to the decoder, along with the generated tokens. The cross-entropy loss between encoder output and the original text will be calculated and then optimized through the learning pro- cess. Think of a transformer where we have two texts in different languages as input to the decoder: the initial text to be translated (source text) and the generated text in the target language. BART can be understood as replacing the former with corrupted text and the latter with the input text itself. Figure 16.16: BART\u2019s model structure To explain the corruption step in a bit more detail, recall that BERT and GPT are pre-trained by recon- structing masked words: BERT is \u201cfilling in the blanks\u201d and GPT is \u201cpredicting the next word.\u201d These pre-training tasks can also be recognized as reconstructing corrupted sentences because masking words is one way of corrupting a sentence. BART provides the following corruption methods that can be applied to the clean text: \u2022 Token masking \u2022 Token deletion \u2022 Text infilling \u2022 Sentence permutation \u2022 Document rotation One or more of the techniques listed above can be applied to the same sentence; in the worst scenario, where all the information is contaminated and corrupted, the text becomes useless. Hence, the encod- er has limited utility, and with only the decoder module working properly, the model will essentially become more similar to a unidirectional language.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 602, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As with BERT, small changes to the inputs need to be made in order to perform different tasks. In the sequence classification task, an additional token needs to be attached to the input to serve as the generated label token, which is similar to the [CLS] token in BERT. Also, instead of disturbing the input, uncorrupted input is fed into both the encoder and decoder so that the model can make full use of the input. For token classification, additional tokens become unnecessary, and the model can directly use the generated representation for each token for classification. Sequence generation in BART differs a bit from GPT because of the existence of the encoder. Instead of generating text from the ground up, sequence generation tasks via BART are more comparable to summarization, where the model is given a corpus of contexts and asked to generate a summary or an abstractive answer to certain questions. To this end, whole input sequences are fed into the encoder while the decoder generates output autoregressively. Finally, it\u2019s natural for BART to perform machine translation considering the similarity between BART and the original transformer. However, instead of following the exact same procedure as for training the original transformer, researchers considered the possibility of incorporating the entire BART model as a pre-trained decoder. To complete the translation model, a new set of randomly initialized parameters is added as a new, additional encoder. Then, the fine-tuning stage can be accomplished in two steps: 1. First, freeze all the parameters except the encoder 2. Then, update all parameters in the model BART was evaluated on several benchmark datasets for various tasks, and it obtained very competi- tive results compared to other famous language models such as BERT. In particular, for generation tasks including abstractive question answering, dialogue response, and summarization tasks, BART achieved state-of-the-art results.

In this section, you will learn how to fine-tune a BERT model for sentiment classification in PyTorch. Note that although there are many other transformer-based models to choose from, BERT provides a nice balance between model popularity and having a manageable model size so that it can be fine- tuned on a single GPU.

Now, we are going to tokenize the texts into individual word tokens using the tokenizer implementation inherited from the pre-trained model class: >>> tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizerFast.from_pretrained( ... 'distilbert-base-uncased' ... ) >>> train_encodings = tokenizer(list(train_texts), truncation=True, padding=True) >>> valid_encodings = tokenizer(list(valid_texts), truncation=True, padding=True) >>> test_encodings = tokenizer(list(test_texts), truncation=True, padding=True) Finally, let\u2019s pack everything into a class called IMDbDataset and create the corresponding data loaders. Such a self-defined dataset class lets us customize all the related features and functions for our custom movie review dataset in DataFrame format: >>> class IMDbDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset): ... def __init__(self, encodings, labels): ... self.encodings = encodings ... self.labels = labels >>> def __getitem__(self, idx): ... item = {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) ... for key, val in self.encodings.items()} ... item['labels'] = torch.tensor(self.labels[idx]) Choosing different tokenizers If you are interested in applying different types of tokenizers, feel free to explore the tokenizers package (https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/), which is also built and maintained by Hugging Face. However, inherited tokenizers main- tain the consistency between the pre-trained model and the dataset, which saves us the extra effort of finding the specific tokenizer corresponding to the model. In other words, using an inherited tokenizer is the recommended approach if you want to fine-tune a pre-trained model.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 606, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The encodings we produced previously store a lot of information about the tokenized texts. Via the dictionary comprehension that we use to assign the dictionary to the item variable, we are only extracting the most relevant information. For instance, the resulting dictionary entries include input_ids (unique integers from the vocabulary correspond- ing to the tokens), labels (the class labels), and attention_mask. Here, attention_mask is a tensor with binary values (0s and 1s) that denotes which tokens the model should attend to. In particular, 0s correspond to tokens used for padding the sequence to equal lengths and are ignored by the model; the 1s correspond to the actual text tokens. Loading and fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model Having taken care of the data preparation, in this subsection, you will see how to load the pre-trained DistilBERT model and fine-tune it using the dataset we just created. The code for loading the pre- trained model is as follows: >>> model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained( ... 'distilbert-base-uncased') >>> model.to(DEVICE) >>> model.train() >>> optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) DistilBertForSequenceClassification specifies the downstream task we want to fine-tune the model on, which is sequence classification in this case. As mentioned before, 'distilbert-base-uncased' is a lightweight version of a BERT uncased base model with manageable size and good performance. Note that \u201cuncased\u201d means that the model does not distinguish between upper- and lower-case letters.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 607, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We can break this up into two parts. First, we need to define an accuracy function to evaluate the model performance. Note that this accuracy function computes the conventional classification accuracy. Why is it so verbose? Here, we are loading the dataset batch by batch to work around RAM or GPU memory (VRAM) limitations when working with a large deep learning model: >>> def compute_accuracy(model, data_loader, device): ... with torch.no_grad(): ... correct_pred, num_examples = 0, 0 ... for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(data_loader): ... ### Prepare data ... input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device) ... attention_mask = \\ ... batch['attention_mask'].to(device) ... labels = batch['labels'].to(device) ... outputs = model(input_ids, ... attention_mask=attention_mask) ... logits = outputs['logits'] ... predicted_labels = torch.argmax(logits, 1) ... num_examples += labels.size(0) ... correct_pred += \\ ... (predicted_labels == labels).sum() ... return correct_pred.float()/num_examples * 100 In the compute_accuracy function, we load a given batch and then obtain the predicted labels from the outputs. While doing this, we keep track of the total number of examples via num_examples. Similarly, we keep track of the number of correct predictions via the correct_pred variable. Finally, after we iterate over the complete dataset, we compute the accuracy as the proportion of correctly predicted labels. Overall, via the compute_accuracy function, you can already get a glimpse at how we can use the transformer model to obtain the class labels. That is, we feed the model the input_ids along with the attention_mask information that, here, denotes whether a token is an actual text token or a token for padding the sequences to equal length. The model call then returns the outputs, which is a transformer library-specific SequenceClassifierOutput object. From this object, we then obtain the logits that we convert into class labels via the argmax function as we have done in previous chapters.

Adjust the weight parameters by backpropagating the loss 4. Evaluate the model performance on both the training and validation set Note that the training time may vary on different devices. After three epochs, accuracy on the test dataset reaches around 93 percent, which is a substantial improvement compared to the 85 percent test accuracy that the RNN achieved in Chapter 15. Fine-tuning a transformer more conveniently using the Trainer API In the previous subsection, we implemented the training loop in PyTorch manually to illustrate that fine-tuning a transformer model is really not that much different from training an RNN or CNN model from scratch. However, note that the transformers library contains several nice extra features for additional convenience, like the Trainer API, which we will introduce in this subsection. The Trainer API provided by Hugging Face is optimized for transformer models with a wide range of training options and various built-in features. When using the Trainer API, we can skip the effort of writing training loops on our own, and training or fine-tuning a transformer model is as simple as a function (or method) call. Let\u2019s see how this works in practice. After loading the pre-trained model via >>> model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained( ... 'distilbert-base-uncased') >>> model.to(DEVICE) >>> model.train(); The training loop from the previous section can then be replaced by the following code: >>> optim = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5) >>> from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 611, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We tried to keep the settings as simple as possible; however, there are many additional settings available, and we recommend consulting the TrainingArguments documentation page for additional details: https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html#trainingarguments. We then passed these TrainingArguments settings to the Trainer class to instantiate a new trainer object. After initiating the trainer with the settings, the model to be fine-tuned, and the training and evaluation sets, we can train the model by calling the trainer.train() method (we will use this method further shortly). That\u2019s it, using the Trainer API is as simple as shown in the preceding code, and no further boilerplate code is required. However, you may have noticed that the test dataset was not involved in these code snippets, and we haven\u2019t specified any evaluation metrics in this subsection. This is because the Trainer API only shows the training loss and does not provide model evaluation along the training process by default. There are two ways to display the final model performance, which we will illustrate next. The first method for evaluating the final model is to define an evaluation function as the compute_ metrics argument for another Trainer instance. The compute_metrics function operates on the models\u2019 test predictions as logits (which is the default output of the model) and the test labels. To instantiate this function, we recommend installing Hugging Face\u2019s datasets library via pip install datasets and use it as follows: >>> from datasets import load_metric >>> import numpy as np >>> metric = load_metric(\"accuracy\") >>> def compute_metrics(eval_pred):", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 612, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

There is a small discrepancy between our manual training approach and using the Trainer class, because the Trainer class uses some different and some additional settings. The second method we could employ to compute the final test set accuracy is re-using our compute_ accuracy function that we defined in the previous section.

This is different from using other deep learning architectures like RNNs, which we usually train from scratch. However, un- less we are doing research and are trying to develop new transformer architectures\u2014a very expensive endeavor\u2014pre-training transformer models is not necessary. Since transformer models are trained on general, unlabeled dataset resources, pre-training them ourselves may not be a good use of our time and resources; fine-tuning is the way to go. Summary In this chapter, we introduced a whole new model architecture for natural language processing, the transformer architecture. The transformer architecture is built on a concept called self-attention, and we started introducing this concept step by step. First, we looked at an RNN outfitted with attention in order to improve its translation capabilities for long sentences. Then, we gently introduced the concept of self-attention and explained how it is used in the multi-head attention module within the transformer. Many different derivatives of the transformer architecture have emerged and evolved since the origi- nal transformer was published in 2017. In this chapter, we focused on a selection of some of the most popular ones: the GPT model family, BERT, and BART. GPT is a unidirectional model that is partic- ularly good at generating new text. BERT takes a bidirectional approach, which is better suited for other types of tasks, for example, classification. Lastly, BART combines both the bidirectional encoder from BERT and the unidirectional decoder from GPT. Interested readers can find out about additional transformer-based architectures via the following two survey articles: 1.

In this chapter, we will explore generative adversarial networks (GANs) and see their application in synthe- sizing new data samples. GANs are considered to be one of the most important breakthroughs in deep learning, allowing computers to generate new data (such as new images). In this chapter, we will cover the following topics: \u2022 Introducing generative models for synthesizing new data \u2022 Autoencoders, variational autoencoders, and their relationship to GANs \u2022 Understanding the building blocks of GANs \u2022 Implementing a simple GAN model to generate handwritten digits \u2022 Understanding transposed convolution and batch normalization \u2022 Improving GANs: deep convolutional GANs and GANs using the Wasserstein distance Introducing generative adversarial networks Let\u2019s first look at the foundations of GAN models. The overall objective of a GAN is to synthesize new data that has the same distribution as its training dataset. Therefore, GANs, in their original form, are considered to be in the unsupervised learning category of machine learning tasks, since no labeled data is required. It is worth noting, however, that extensions made to the original GAN can lie in both the semi-supervised and supervised domains. The general GAN concept was first proposed in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues as a meth- od for synthesizing new images using deep neural networks (NNs) (Generative Adversarial Nets, in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems by I. Goodfellow, J. Pouget-Abadie, M. Mirza, B. Xu, D. Warde-Farley, S. Ozair, A. Courville, and Y. Bengio, pp. 2672-2680, 2014).

For instance, recent advances in GAN research have led to models that are able to generate new, high-resolution face images. Examples of such high-resolution images can be found on https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/, which showcases synthetic face images generated by a GAN. Starting with autoencoders Before we discuss how GANs work, we will first start with autoencoders, which can compress and decompress training data. While standard autoencoders cannot generate new data, understanding their function will help you to navigate GANs in the next section. Autoencoders are composed of two networks concatenated together: an encoder network and a de- coder network. The encoder network receives a d-dimensional input feature vector associated with example x (that is, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51) and encodes it into a p-dimensional vector, z (that is, \ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d). In other words, the role of the encoder is to learn how to model the function z = f(x). The encoded vector, z, is also called the latent vector, or the latent feature representation. Typically, the dimensionality of the latent vector is less than that of the input examples; in other words, p < d. Hence, we can say that the encoder acts as a data compression function. Then, the decoder decompresses \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0302 from the low- er-dimensional latent vector, z, where we can think of the decoder as a function, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0302 = \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b). A simple autoencoder architecture is shown in Figure 17.1, where the encoder and decoder parts consist of only one fully connected layer each: Figure 17.1: The architecture of an autoencoder", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 619, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Also, note that the autoencoder mentioned in this section uses fully connected layers. When we work with images, however, we can replace the fully connected layers with convolutional layers, as you learned in Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. The connection between autoencoders and dimensionality reduction In Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction, you learned about dimen- sionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Autoencoders can be used as a dimensionality reduction technique as well. In fact, when there is no nonlinearity in either of the two subnetworks (encoder and decoder), then the autoencoder approach is almost identical to PCA. In this case, if we assume the weights of a single-layer encoder (no hidden layer and no nonlinear activation function) are denoted by the matrix U, then the encoder models z = U Tx. Similarly, a single-layer linear decoder models \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0302 = \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c. Putting these two compo- nents together, we have \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0302 = \ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc7c\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99 . This is exactly what PCA does, with the exception that PCA has an additional orthonormal constraint: UU T = In\u00d7n. Other types of autoencoders based on the size of latent space As previously mentioned, the dimensionality of an autoencoder\u2019s latent space is typically lower than the dimensionality of the inputs (p < d), which makes autoencoders suitable for dimensionality reduction. For this reason, the latent vector is also often referred to as the \u201cbottleneck,\u201d and this particular configuration of an autoencoder is also called under- complete. However, there is a different category of autoencoders, called overcomplete, where the dimensionality of the latent vector, z, is, in fact, greater than the dimensionality of the input examples (p > d). When training an overcomplete autoencoder, there is a trivial solution where the encoder and the decoder can simply learn to copy (memorize) the input features to their output layer. Obviously, this solution is not very useful. However, with some modifications to the training procedure, overcomplete autoencoders can be used for noise reduction. In this case, during training, random noise, \ud835\udf50\ud835\udf50 , is added to the input examples and the network learns to reconstruct the clean example, x, from the noisy signal, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99 . Then, at evaluation time, we provide the new examples that are naturally noisy (that is, noise is already present such that no additional artificial noise, \ud835\udf50\ud835\udf50 , is added) in order to remove the existing noise from these examples. This particular autoencoder architecture and training method is referred to as a denoising autoencoder. If you are interested, you can learn more about it in the research article Stacked denoising autoencoders: Learning useful representations in a deep network with a local denoising criterion by Pascal Vincent and colleagues, 2010 (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v11/vincent10a. html).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 620, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Therefore, it cannot generate new data beyond reconstructing its input through the transfor- mation of the compressed representation. A generative model, on the other hand, can generate a new example, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303 , from a random vector, z (cor- responding to the latent representation). A schematic representation of a generative model is shown in the following figure. The random vector, z, comes from a distribution with fully known characteristics, so we can easily sample from such a distribution. For example, each element of z may come from the uniform distribution in the range [\u20131, 1] (for which we write \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56~ Uniform(\u22121, 1)) or from a standard normal distribution (in which case, we write \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56~ Normal(\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf072 = 1)): Figure 17.2: A generative model As we have shifted our attention from autoencoders to generative models, you may have noticed that the decoder component of an autoencoder has some similarities with a generative model. In particular, they both receive a latent vector, z, as input and return an output in the same space as x. (For the auto- encoder, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0302 is the reconstruction of an input, x, and for the generative model, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303 is a synthesized sample.) However, the major difference between the two is that we do not know the distribution of z in the autoen- coder, while in a generative model, the distribution of z is fully characterizable. It is possible to generalize an autoencoder into a generative model, though. One approach is the variational autoencoder (VAE). In a VAE receiving an input example, x, the encoder network is modified in such a way that it com- putes two moments of the distribution of the latent vector: the mean, \ud835\udf41\ud835\udf41, and variance, \ud835\udf48\ud835\udf482. During the training of a VAE, the network is forced to match these moments with those of a standard normal distribution (that is, zero mean and unit variance). Then, after the VAE model is trained, the encoder is discarded, and we can use the decoder network to generate new examples, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303 , by feeding random z vectors from the \u201clearned\u201d Gaussian distribution.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 621, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

However, in this chapter, we are only going to focus on GAN models, which are among the most recent and most popular types of generative models in deep learning. Generating new samples with GANs To understand what GANs do in a nutshell, let\u2019s first assume we have a network that receives a random vector, z, sampled from a known distribution, and generates an output image, x. We will call this network generator (G) and use the notation \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303 = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b) to refer to the generated output. Assume our goal is to generate some images, for example, face images, images of buildings, images of animals, or even handwritten digits such as MNIST. As always, we will initialize this network with random weights. Therefore, the first output images, before these weights are adjusted, will look like white noise. Now, imagine there is a function that can assess the quality of images (let\u2019s call it an assessor function). If such a function exists, we can use the feedback from that function to tell our generator network how to adjust its weights to improve the quality of the generated images. This way, we can train the generator based on the feedback from that assessor function, such that the generator learns to improve its output toward producing realistic-looking images. While an assessor function, as described in the previous paragraph, would make the image generation task very easy, the question is whether such a universal function to assess the quality of images exists and, if so, how it is defined. Obviously, as humans, we can easily assess the quality of output images when we observe the outputs of the network; although, we cannot (yet) backpropagate the result from our brain to the network. Now, if our brain can assess the quality of synthesized images, can we design an NN model to do the same thing? In fact, that\u2019s the general idea of a GAN. What is a generative model? Note that generative models are traditionally defined as algorithms that model data input distributions, p(x), or the joint distributions of the input data and associated targets, p(x, y). By definition, these models are also capable of sampling from some feature, xi, conditioned on another feature, xj, which is known as conditional inference. In the context of deep learning, however, the term generative model is typically used to refer to models that generate realistic-looking data. This means that we can sample from input distributions, p(x), but we are not necessarily able to perform conditional inference.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 622, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

At first, after initializing the model weights, the generator creates images that do not look realistic. Similarly, the discriminator does a poor job of distinguishing between real images and images synthesized by the generator. But over time (that is, through training), both networks become better as they interact with each other. In fact, the two networks play an adversarial game, where the generator learns to improve its output to be able to fool the discriminator. At the same time, the discriminator becomes better at detecting the synthesized images.

A prac- tical way of training GANs is to alternate between these two optimization steps: (1) fix (freeze) the parameters of one network and optimize the weights of the other one, and (2) fix the second network and optimize the first one. This process should be repeated at each training iteration. Let\u2019s assume that the generator network is fixed, and we want to optimize the discriminator. Both terms in the value function \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37), \ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a)) contribute to optimizing the discriminator, where the first term corresponds to the loss associated with the real examples, and the second term is the loss for the fake examples.

After optimizing the discriminator using the loss terms for real and fake samples, we then fix the dis- criminator and optimize the generator.

The reason for this is that the outputs, G(z), early in the learning process, look nothing like real examples, and therefore D(G(z)) will be close to zero with high confidence. This phenomenon is called saturation. To resolve this issue, we can reformulate the minimization objective, min \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b) [log (1 \u2212\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b)))], by rewriting it as max \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b) [log (\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b)))]. This replacement means that for training the generator, we can swap the labels of real and fake examples and carry out a regular function minimization. In other words, even though the examples synthesized by the generator are fake and are therefore labeled 0, we can flip the labels by assigning label 1 to these examples and minimize the binary cross-entropy loss with these new labels instead of maximizing max \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b) [log (\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b)))]. Now that we have covered the general optimization procedure for training GAN models, let\u2019s explore the various data labels that we can use when training GANs. Given that the discriminator is a binary classifier (the class labels are 0 and 1 for fake and real images, respectively), we can use the binary cross-entropy loss function. Therefore, we can determine the ground truth labels for the discriminator loss as follows: Ground truth labels for the discriminator = { 1: for real images, i.e., \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99 0: for outputs of \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a, i.e., \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b) What about the labels to train the generator? As we want the generator to synthesize realistic images, we want to penalize the generator when its outputs are not classified as real by the discriminator. This means that we will assume the ground truth labels for the outputs of the generator to be 1 when computing the loss function for the generator.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 624, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Google Colab provides Jupyter Notebook instances that run on the cloud; the notebooks can be saved on Google Drive or GitHub. While the platform provides various different computing resources, such as CPUs, GPUs, and even tensor processing units (TPUs), it is important to highlight that the execution time is currently limited to 12 hours. Therefore, any notebook running longer than 12 hours will be interrupted. The code blocks in this chapter will need a maximum computing time of two to three hours, so this will not be an issue. However, if you decide to use Google Colab for other projects that take longer than 12 hours, be sure to use checkpointing and save intermediate checkpoints. Accessing Google Colab is very straightforward. You can visit https://colab.research.google.com, which automatically takes you to a prompt window where you can see your existing Jupyter notebooks. From this prompt window, click the Google Drive tab, as shown in Figure 17.5. This is where you will save the notebook on your Google Drive.

If you recall, the ReLU activation function was defined as \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e(\ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67) = max(0, \ud835\udc67\ud835\udc67), which suppresses the negative (pre- activation) inputs; that is, negative inputs are set to zero. Consequently, using the ReLU activation function may result in sparse gradients during backpropagation. Sparse gradi- ents are not always detrimental and can even benefit models for classification. However, in certain applications, such as GANs, it can be beneficial to obtain the gradients for the full range of input values, which we can achieve by making a slight modification to the ReLU function such that it outputs small values for negative inputs. This modified version of the ReLU function is also known as leaky ReLU. In short, the leaky ReLU activation function permits non-zero gradients for negative inputs as well, and as a result, it makes the networks more expressive overall.

The reason for that was that the fake examples were nothing like the real ones; therefore, distinguishing between real and fake was rather easy.

In the next section, we will implement a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN), which uses convolutional layers for both the generator and the discriminator networks. Improving the quality of synthesized images using a convolutional and Wasserstein GAN In this section, we will implement a DCGAN, which will enable us to improve the performance we saw in the previous GAN example. Additionally, we will briefly talk about an extra key technique, Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). The techniques that we will cover in this section will include the following: \u2022 Transposed convolution \u2022 Batch normalization (BatchNorm) \u2022 WGAN The DCGAN was proposed in 2016 by A. Radford, L. Metz, and S. Chintala in their article Unsupervised representation learning with deep convolutional generative adversarial networks, which is freely available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf. In this article, the researchers proposed using convolu- tional layers for both the generator and discriminator networks. Starting from a random vector, z, the DCGAN first uses a fully connected layer to project z into a new vector with a proper size so that it can be reshaped into a spatial convolution representation (h\u00d7w\u00d7c), which is smaller than the output image size. Then, a series of convolutional layers, known as transposed convolution, are used to upsample the feature maps to the desired output image size. Transposed convolution In Chapter 14, you learned about the convolution operation in one- and two-dimensional spaces. In particular, we looked at how the choices for the padding and strides change the output feature maps. While a convolution operation is usually used to downsample the feature space (for example, by set- ting the stride to 2, or by adding a pooling layer after a convolutional layer), a transposed convolution operation is usually used for upsampling the feature space. To understand the transposed convolution operation, let\u2019s go through a simple thought experiment. Assume that we have an input feature map of size n\u00d7n. Then, we apply a 2D convolution operation with certain padding and stride parameters to this n\u00d7n input, resulting in an output feature map of size m\u00d7m. Now, the question is, how we can apply another convolution operation to obtain a feature map with the initial dimension n\u00d7n from this m\u00d7m output feature map while maintaining the connectivity patterns between the input and output? Note that only the shape of the n\u00d7n input matrix is recovered and not the actual matrix values.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 641, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The matrix of size 9\u00d79 in the center shows the results after inserting such 0s into the input feature map. Then, performing a normal convolution using the 2\u00d72 kernel with a stride of 1 results in an output of size 8\u00d78. We can verify the backward direction by performing a regular convolution on the output with a stride of 2, which results in an output feature map of size 4\u00d74, which is the same as the original input size: Figure 17.13: Applying transposed convolution to a 4\u00d74 input Transposed convolution versus deconvolution Transposed convolution is also called fractionally strided convolution. In deep learning literature, another common term that is used to refer to transposed convolution is decon- volution.

Batch normalization BatchNorm was introduced in 2015 by Sergey Ioffe and Christian Szegedy in the article Batch Normal- ization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift, which you can access via arXiv at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf. One of the main ideas behind BatchNorm is normalizing the layer inputs and preventing changes in their distribution during training, which enables faster and better convergence. BatchNorm transforms a mini-batch of features based on its computed statistics. Assume that we have the net preactivation feature maps obtained after a convolutional layer in a four-dimensional tensor, Z, with the shape [m\u00d7c\u00d7h\u00d7w], where m is the number of examples in the batch (i.e., batch size), h\u00d7w is the spatial dimension of the feature maps, and c is the number of channels.

As a consequence, these net inputs are mean-centered and have unit variance, which is generally a useful property for gradient descent-based optimization. On the other hand, always normalizing the net inputs such that they have the same properties across the different mini-batches, which can be diverse, can severely impact the representational capacity of NNs.

Note that the behavior for updating the learnable parameters, \ud835\udf38\ud835\udf38 and \ud835\udf37\ud835\udf37, depends on whether the model is a training model not. These parameters are learned only during training and are then used for normalization during evaluation. Implementing the generator and discriminator At this point, we have covered the main components of a DCGAN model, which we will now implement. The architectures of the generator and discriminator networks are summarized in the following two figures. The generator takes a vector, z, of size 100 as input. Then, a series of transposed convolutions using nn.ConvTranspose2d() upsamples the feature maps until the spatial dimension of the resulting feature maps reaches 28\u00d728. The number of channels is reduced by half after each transposed convolutional layer, except the last one, which uses only one output filter to generate a grayscale image. Each trans- posed convolutional layer is followed by BatchNorm and leaky ReLU activation functions, except the last one, which uses tanh activation (without BatchNorm). Why does BatchNorm help optimization? Initially, BatchNorm was developed to reduce the so-called internal covariance shift, which is defined as the changes that occur in the distribution of a layer\u2019s activations due to the updated network parameters during training. To explain this with a simple example, consider a fixed batch that passes through the network at epoch 1. We record the activations of each layer for this batch. After iterating through the whole training dataset and updating the model parameters, we start the second epoch, where the previously fixed batch passes through the network. Then, we compare the layer activations from the first and second epochs. Since the network parameters have changed, we observe that the activations have also changed. This phenomenon is called the internal covariance shift, which was believed to decelerate NN training. However, in 2018, S. Santurkar, D. Tsipras, A. Ilyas, and A. Madry further investigated what makes BatchNorm so effective. In their study, the researchers observed that the effect of BatchNorm on the internal covariance shift is marginal. Based on the outcome of their experiments, they hypothesized that the effectiveness of BatchNorm is, instead, based on a smoother surface of the loss function, which makes the non-convex optimization more robust.

In the next subsection, we will cover WGAN, which uses a modified loss function based on the so- called Wasserstein-1 (or earth mover\u2019s) distance between the distributions of real and fake images for improving the training performance. Dissimilarity measures between two distributions We will first see different measures for computing the divergence between two distributions. Then, we will see which one of these measures is already embedded in the original GAN model. Finally, switching this measure in GANs will lead us to the implementation of a WGAN. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, the goal of a generative model is to learn how to syn- thesize new samples that have the same distribution as the distribution of the training dataset. Let P(x) and Q(x) represent the distribution of a random variable, x, as shown in the following figure.

The infimum function in the EM distance is taken over \u03a0(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43), which is the collection of all joint distributions whose marginals are P or Q.

Computing EM distance is an optimization problem by itself, which is to find the optimal transfer plan, \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62). \u2022 The Kullback-Leibler (KL) and Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence measures come from the field of information theory. Note that KL divergence is not symmetric, that is, \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\u2016\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44) \u2260\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\u2016\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43) in contrast to JS divergence. The dissimilarity equations provided in Figure 17.18 correspond to continuous distributions but can be extended for discrete cases. An example of calculating these different dissimilarity measures with two simple discrete distributions is illustrated in Figure 17.19: Figure 17.19: An example of calculating the different dissimilarity measures Note that, in the case of the EM distance, for this simple example, we can see that Q(x) at x = 2 has the excess value of 0.5 \u2212 1 3 = 0.166 , while the value of Q at the other two x\u2019s is below 1/3. Therefore, the minimal amount of work is when we transfer the extra value at x = 2 to x = 1 and x = 3, as shown in Figure 17.19.

It can be mathematically shown that the loss function in the original GAN indeed minimizes the JS divergence between the distribution of real and fake examples. But, as discussed in an article by Martin Arjovsky and colleagues (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks, http:// proceedings.mlr.press/v70/arjovsky17a/arjovsky17a.pdf), JS divergence has problems training a GAN model, and therefore, in order to improve the training, the researchers proposed using the EM distance as a measure of dissimilarity between the distribution of real and fake examples.

What is the advantage of using EM distance? To answer this question, we can consider an example that was given in the previously mentioned article by Martin Arjovsky and colleagues. To put it in simple words, assume we have two distributions, P and Q, which are two parallel lines. One line is fixed at x = 0 and the other line can move across the x-axis but is initially located at \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65, where \ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03. It can be shown that the KL, TV, and JS dissimilarity measures are \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\u2016\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44) = +\u221e , \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43) = 1, and \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc3d(\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43) = 1 2 log 2. None of these dissimilarity measures are a function of the parameter \ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03, and therefore, they cannot be differentiated with respect to \ud835\udf03\ud835\udf03 toward making the distributions, P and Q, become similar to each other.

As was mentioned earlier, computing the EM distance is an optimization problem by itself; therefore, this becomes computationally intractable, especially if we want to repeat this computation in each iteration of the GAN training loop. Fortunately, though, the computation of the EM distance can be simplified using a theorem called Kantorovich-Ru- binstein duality, as follows: \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f, \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54) = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 \u2016\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\u2016\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\u22641 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f[\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc62)] \u2212\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc54[\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63)] Here, the supremum is taken over all the 1-Lipschitz continuous functions denoted by \u2016\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\u2016\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f\u22641. Using EM distance in practice for GANs Now, the question is, how do we find such a 1-Lipschitz continuous function to compute the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of real (Pr) and fake (Pg) outputs for a GAN? While the theoretical concepts behind the WGAN approach may seem complicated at first, the answer to this question is simpler than it may appear. Recall that we consider deep NNs to be universal function approximators. This means that we can simply train an NN model to approximate the Wasserstein distance function. As you saw in the previous section, the simple GAN uses a discriminator in the form of a classifier. For WGAN, the discriminator can be changed to behave as a critic, which returns a scalar score instead of a probability value. We can interpret this score as how realistic the input images are (like an art critic giving scores to artworks in a gallery). To train a GAN using the Wasserstein distance, the losses for the discriminator, D, and generator, G, are defined as follows. The critic (that is, the discriminator network) returns its outputs for the batch of real image examples and the batch of synthesized examples. We use the notations D(x) and D(G(z)), respectively. Lipschitz continuity Based on 1-Lipschitz continuity, the function, f, must satisfy the following property: |\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651) \u2212\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652)| \u2264|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652| Furthermore, a real function, f:R\u2192R, that satisfies the property |\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651) \u2212\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652)| \u2264\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3e|\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc651 \u2212\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc652| is called K-Lipschitz continuous.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 656, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For this purpose, the WGAN paper proposes clamping the weights to a small region, for example, [\u20130.01, 0.01]. Gradient penalty In the paper by Arjovsky and colleagues, weight clipping is suggested for the 1-Lipschitz property of the discriminator (or critic). However, in another paper titled Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs by Ishaan Gulrajani and colleagues, 2017, which is freely available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00028. pdf, Ishaan Gulrajani and colleagues showed that clipping the weights can lead to exploding and vanishing gradients. Furthermore, weight clipping can also lead to capacity underuse, which means that the critic network is limited to learning only some simple functions, as opposed to more complex functions. Therefore, rather than clipping the weights, Ishaan Gulrajani and colleagues proposed gra- dient penalty (GP) as an alternative solution. The result is the WGAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP). The procedure for the GP that is added in each iteration can be summarized by the following sequence of steps: 1. For each pair of real and fake examples (\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56], \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56]) in a given batch, choose a random number, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56], sampled from a uniform distribution, that is, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] \u2208\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48(0,1) . 2. Calculate an interpolation between the real and fake examples: \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u030c[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] = \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56] + (1 \u2212\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc)\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56], re- sulting in a batch of interpolated examples. 3. Compute the discriminator (critic) output for all the interpolated examples, \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\u030c[\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56]). 4.

Implementing WGAN-GP to train the DCGAN model We have already defined the helper function and class that create the generator and discriminator networks for DCGAN (make_generator_network() and Discriminator()).

Here are a few suggested tricks from GAN artists. One approach is called mini-batch discrimination, which is based on the fact that batches consisting of only real or fake examples are fed separately to the discriminator. In mini-batch discrimination, we let the discriminator compare examples across these batches to see whether a batch is real or fake. The diversity of a batch consisting of only real examples is most likely higher than the diversity of a fake batch if a model suffers from mode collapse. Another technique that is commonly used for stabilizing GAN training is feature matching. In feature matching, we make a slight modification to the objective function of the generator by adding an extra term that minimizes the difference between the original and synthesized images based on interme- diate representations (feature maps) of the discriminator. We encourage you to read more about this technique in the original article by Ting-Chun Wang and colleagues, titled High Resolution Image Syn- thesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs, which is freely available at https://arxiv. org/pdf/1711.11585.pdf. During the training, a GAN model can also get stuck in several modes and just hop between them. To avoid this behavior, you can store some old examples and feed them to the discriminator to prevent the generator from revisiting previous modes. This technique is referred to as experience replay. Fur- thermore, you can train multiple GANs with different random seeds so that the combination of all of them covers a larger part of the data distribution than any single one of them.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 663, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The applications of GANs are expanding rapidly, including in computer vision, machine learning, and even other domains of science and en- gineering. A nice list of different GAN models and application areas can be found at https://github. com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo. It is worth mentioning that we covered GANs in an unsupervised fashion; that is, no class label in- formation was used in the models that were covered in this chapter. However, the GAN approach can be generalized to semi-supervised and supervised tasks, as well. For example, the conditional GAN (cGAN) proposed by Mehdi Mirza and Simon Osindero in the paper Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets, 2014 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1784.pdf) uses the class label information and learns to synthesize new images conditioned on the provided label, that is, \ud835\udc99\ud835\udc99\u0303 = \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a(\ud835\udc9b\ud835\udc9b|\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66)\u2014applied to MNIST. This allows us to generate different digits in the range 0-9 selectively. Furthermore, conditional GANs allow us to do image-to-image translation, which is to learn how to convert a given image from a specific domain to another. In this context, one interesting work is the Pix2Pix algorithm, published in the paper Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks by Philip Isola and colleagues, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004.pdf). It is worth mentioning that in the Pix2Pix algorithm, the discriminator provides the real/fake predictions for multiple patches across the image as opposed to a single prediction for an entire image. CycleGAN is another interesting GAN model built on top of the cGAN, also for image-to-image trans- lation. However, note that in CycleGAN, the training examples from the two domains are unpaired, meaning that there is no one-to-one correspondence between inputs and outputs. For example, using a CycleGAN, we could change the season of a picture taken in summer to winter. In the paper Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation Using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks by Jun-Yan Zhu and colleagues, 2020 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf), an impressive example shows horses converted into zebras. Summary In this chapter, you first learned about generative models in deep learning and their overall objective: synthesizing new data. We then covered how GAN models use a generator network and a discrimina- tor network, which compete with each other in an adversarial training setting to improve each other. Next, we implemented a simple GAN model using only fully connected layers for both the generator and the discriminator. We also covered how GAN models can be improved. First, you saw a DCGAN, which uses deep convo- lutional networks for both the generator and the discriminator. Along the way, you also learned about two new concepts: transposed convolution (for upsampling the spatial dimensionality of feature maps) and BatchNorm (for improving convergence during training). We then looked at a WGAN, which uses the EM distance to measure the distance between the distribu- tions of real and fake samples. Finally, we talked about the WGAN with GP to maintain the 1-Lipschitz property instead of clipping the weights.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 664, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Figure 18.3: An example of a directed graph Labeled graphs Many graphs we are interested in working with have additional information associated with each of their nodes and edges. For example, if you consider the caffeine molecule shown earlier, molecules can be represented as graphs where each node is a chemical element (for example, O, C, N, or H atoms) and each edge is the type of bond (for example, single or double bond) between its two nodes. These node and edge features need to be encoded in some capacity. Given graph G, defined by the node set and edge set tuple (V, E), we define a |V|\u00d7fV node feature matrix X, where fV is the length of the label vector of each node. For edge labels, we define an |E|\u00d7fE edge feature matrix XE, where fE is the length of the label vector of each edge. Molecules are an excellent example of data that can be represented as a labeled graph, and we will be working with molecular data throughout the chapter. As such, we will take this opportunity to cover their representation in detail in the next section. Representing molecules as graphs As a chemical overview, molecules can be thought of as groups of atoms held together by chemical bonds. There are different atoms corresponding to different chemical elements, for example, common elements include carbon (C), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), and hydrogen (H). Also, there are different kinds of bonds that form the connection between atoms, for example, single or double bonds. We can represent a molecule as an undirected graph with a node label matrix, where each row is a one-hot encoding of the associated node\u2019s atom type. Additionally, there is an edge label matrix where each row is a one-hot encoding of the associated edge\u2019s bond type. To simplify this representation, hydrogen atoms are sometimes made implicit since their location can be inferred with basic chemical rules. Considering the caffeine molecule we saw earlier, an example of a graph representation with implicit hydrogen atoms is shown in Figure 18.4:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 669, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In this section, we\u2019ll see why we want to use convolutions on graphs and discuss what attributes we want those convolutions to have. We\u2019ll then introduce graph convolutions through an implementation example. The motivation behind using graph convolutions To help explain graph convolutions, let\u2019s briefly recap how convolutions are utilized in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which we discussed in Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. In the context of images, we can think of a convolution as the process of sliding a convolutional filter over an image, where, at each step, a weighted sum is computed between the filter and the receptive field (the part of the image it is currently on top of).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 670, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

This ap- proach to feature detection is well-suited for images for several reasons, for instance, the following priors we can place on image data: 1. Shift-invariance: We can still recognize a feature in an image regardless of where it is located (for example, after translation). A cat can be recognized as a cat whether it is in the top left, bottom right, or another part of an image. 2. Locality: Nearby pixels are closely related. 3. Hierarchy: Larger parts of an image can often be broken down into combinations of associated smaller parts. A cat has a head and legs; the head has eyes and a nose; the eyes have pupils and irises. Interested readers can find a more formal description of these priors, and priors assumed by GNNs, in the 2019 article Understanding the Representation Power of Graph Neural Networks in Learning Graph Topology, by N. Dehmamy, A.-L. Barabasi, and R. Yu (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05008). Another reason convolutions are well-suited for processing images is that the number of trainable parameters does not depend on the dimensionality of the input. You could train a series of 3\u00d73 con- volutional filters on, for example, a 256\u00d7256 or a 9\u00d79 image. (However, if the same image is presented in different resolutions, the receptive fields and, therefore, the extracted features will differ. And for higher-resolution images, we may want to choose larger kernels or add additional layers to extract useful features effectively.) Like images, graphs also have natural priors that justify a convolutional approach. Both kinds of data, images and graphs, share the locality prior. However, how we define locality differs. In images, the prior is on locality in 2D space, while with graphs, it is structural locality. Intuitively, this means that a node that is one edge away is more likely to be related than a node five edges away. For example, in a citation graph, a directly cited publication, which would be one edge away, is more likely to have similar subject matter than a publication with multiple degrees of separation. A strict prior for graph data is permutation invariance, which means that the ordering of the nodes does not affect the output. This is illustrated in Figure 18.5, where changing the ordering of a graph\u2019s nodes does not change the graph\u2019s structure:", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 671, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

A convolutional approach is also desirable for graphs because it can function with a fixed parame- ter set for graphs of different sizes. This property is arguably even more important for graphs than images. For instance, there are many image datasets with a fixed resolution where a fully connected approach (for example, using a multilayer perceptron) could be possible, as we have seen in Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch. In contrast, most graph datasets contain graphs of varying sizes. While image convolutional operators are standardized, there are many different kinds of graph con- volutions, and the development of new graph convolutions is a very active area of research.

If a value at a node is highly correlated with the value at another node many edges away, a single convolution will not capture that relationship.

This is where we utilize the adjacency matrix A. The matrix form of this convolution is XW1 + AXW2. Here, the adjacency matrix, consisting of 1s and 0s, acts as a mask to select nodes and compute the desired sums. In NumPy, ini- tializing this layer and computing a forward pass on the previous graph could be written as follows: >>> f_in, f_out = X.shape[1], 6 >>> W_1 = np.random.rand(f_in, f_out) >>> W_2 = np.random.rand(f_in, f_out) >>> h = np.dot(X, W_1)+ np.dot(np.dot(A,X), W_2) Computing a forward pass of a graph convolution is that easy. Ultimately, we want a graph convolutional layer to update the representation of the node information encoded in X by utilizing the structural (connectivity) information provided by A. There are many potential ways to do this, and this plays out in the numerous kinds of graph convolutions that have been developed. To talk about different graph convolutions, generally, it would be nice for them to have a unifying framework. Thankfully, such a framework was presented in Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chem- istry by Justin Gilmer and colleagues, 2017, https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01212. In this message-passing framework, each node in the graph has an associated hidden state \u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61), where i is the node\u2019s index at time step t. The initial value \u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (0) is defined as Xi, which is the row of X associated with node i. Each graph convolution can be split into a message-passing phase and a node update phase. Let N(i) be the neighbors of node i. For undirected graphs, N(i) is the set of nodes that share an edge with node i. For directed graphs, N(i) is the set of nodes that have an edge whose endpoint is node i. The message-passing phase can be formulated as follows: \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56= \u2211\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61(\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61), \u210e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) Here, Mt is a message function. In our example layer, we define this message function as \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \u210e\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc4a2. The node update phase with the update function Ut is \u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61(\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61), \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56).

Global pooling can be done with any permutation invariant function, for example, sum, max, and mean. Here is the implementation of global_sum_pool(): def global_sum_pool(X, batch_mat): if batch_mat is None or batch_mat.dim() == 1: return torch.sum(X, dim=0).unsqueeze(0) else: return torch.mm(batch_mat, X) If data is not batched or the batch size is one, this function just sums over the current node embed- dings. Otherwise, the embeddings are multiplied with batch_mat, which has a structure based on how graph data is batched. When all data in a dataset has the same dimensionality, batching the data is as straightforward as adding a dimension by stacking the data. (Side note: the function called in the default batching func- tion in PyTorch is literally called stack.) Since graph sizes vary, this approach is not feasible with graph data unless padding is used. However, padding can be inefficient in cases where graph sizes can vary substantially. Usually, the better way to deal with varying graph sizes is to treat each batch as a single graph where each graph in the batch is a subgraph that is disconnected from the rest.

As a result, when backpropagating gradients of GB through graph convolutions, the gradients attached to each graph in the batch will be independent.

Since we won\u2019t actually be training this model on a real-world task, we just set the labels arbitrarily.

You now understand how to construct, set up, and run a basic GNN. However, from this introduction, you probably realize that managing and manipulating graph data can be somewhat laborious.

Implementing a GNN using the PyTorch Geometric library In this section, we will implement a GNN using the PyTorch Geometric library, which simplifies the process of training GNNs. We apply the GNN to QM9, a dataset consisting of small molecules, to pre- dict isotropic polarizability, which is a measure of a molecule\u2019s tendency to have its charge distorted by an electric field.

(If you are interested in the implementation details, its source code be found at https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs. io/en/latest/_modules/torch_geometric/nn/conv/nn_conv.html#NNConv.)

This graph convolution is very similar to the one we implemented previously from scratch: \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) = \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e1\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \u2211\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 (\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e2 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57(\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) The only real difference is that the W2 equivalent, the neural network h, is parametrized based on the edge labels, which allows the weights to vary for different edge labels. Via the following code, we implement a GNN utilizing two such graph convolutional layers (NNConv): class ExampleNet(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self, num_node_features, num_edge_features): super().__init__() conv1_net = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(num_edge_features, 32), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(32, num_node_features*32)) conv2_net = nn.Sequential( nn.Linear(num_edge_features, 32), nn.ReLU(), nn.Linear(32, 32*16)) self.conv1 = NNConv(num_node_features, 32, conv1_net) self.conv2 = NNConv(32,16, conv2_net) The QM9 dataset The QM9 dataset contains 133,885 small organic molecules labeled with several geomet- ric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties.

The following code predicts the values on the test data and collects the true labels: >>> net.eval() >>> predictions = [] >>> real = [] >>> for batch in testloader: ... output = net(batch.to(device)) ... predictions.append(output.detach().cpu().numpy()) ... real.append( ... batch.y[:,target_idx] .detach().cpu().numpy()) >>> real = np.concatenate(real) >>> predictions = np.concatenate(predictions) Now we can make a scatterplot with a subset of the test data. Since the test dataset is relatively large (10,000 molecules), the results can be a bit cluttered, and for simplicity, we only plot the first 500 predictions and targets: >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt >>> plt.scatter(real[:500], predictions[:500]) >>> plt.xlabel('Isotropic polarizability') >>> plt.ylabel('Predicted isotropic polarizability') The resulting figure is shown here: Figure 18.12: Predicted isotropic polarizability plotted against the actual isotropic polarizability", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 693, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Other GNN layers and recent developments This section will introduce a selection of additional layers that you can utilize in your GNNs, in addition to providing a high-level overview of some recent developments in the field. While we will provide background on the intuition behind these layers and their implementations, these concepts can become a little complicated mathematically speaking, but don\u2019t get discouraged. These are optional topics, and it is not necessary to grasp the minutiae of all these implementations. Understanding the general ideas behind the layers will be sufficient to experiment with the PyTorch Geometric imple- mentations that we reference. The following subsections will introduce spectral graph convolution layers, graph pooling layers, and normalization layers for graphs. Lastly, the final subsection will provide a bird\u2019s eye view of some more advanced kinds of graph neural networks. Spectral graph convolutions The graph convolutions we have utilized up to this point have all been spatial in nature. This means that they aggregate information based on the topological space associated with the graph, which is just a fancy way of saying that spatial convolutions operate on local neighborhoods of nodes. As a consequence of this, if a GNN that utilizes spatial convolutions needs to capture complex global pat- terns in graph data, then the network will need to stack multiple spatial convolutions. In situations where these global patterns are important, but network depth needs to be limited, spectral graph convolutions are an alternative kind of convolution to consider. Spectral graph convolutions operate differently than spatial graph convolutions. Spectral graph con- volutions operate by utilizing the graph\u2019s spectrum\u2014its set of eigenvalues\u2014by computing the eigende- composition of a normalized version of the graph\u2019s adjacency matrix called the graph Laplacian. That last sentence may seem like a doozy, so let\u2019s break it down and go over it step by step. For an undirected graph, the Laplacian matrix of a graph is defined as L = D \u2013 A, where A is the ad- jacency matrix of the graph and D is the degree matrix. A degree matrix is a diagonal matrix where the element on the diagonal in the row with index i is the number of edges in and out of the node associated with the ith row of the adjacency matrix. TorchDrug \u2013 A PyTorch-based library for drug discovery PyTorch Geometric is a comprehensive general-purpose library for working with graphs, including molecules, as you have seen in this section.

You can think of Q as pro- viding an underlying representation of the graph\u2019s structure. Unlike spatial convolutions, which use local neighborhoods of the graph that are defined by A, spectral convolutions utilize the alternative representation of the structure from Q to update the node embeddings. The following example of a spectral convolution utilizes the eigendecomposition of the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian, which is defined for a graph as follows: \ud835\udc73\ud835\udc73\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60= \ud835\udc70\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc70\ud835\udc70\u22121 2\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\u22121 2 Here, I is the identity matrix. This is used because the normalization of the graph Laplacian can help stabilize the gradient-based training procedure similar to feature standardization.

The inside of the parentheses essentially multiplies X and W by a matrix that encodes structural relationships in the graph. The \u2299 operator here denotes element-wise multiplication of the inner terms, while the outside Q maps the result back into the original basis. This convolution has a few undesirable properties, since computing a graph\u2019s eigendecomposition has a computational complexity of O(n 3). This means that it is slow, and as it is structured, W is dependent on the size of the graph. Consequently, the spectral convolution can only be applied to graphs of the same size. Furthermore, the receptive field of this convolution is the whole graph, and this cannot be tuned in the current formulation. However, various techniques and convolutions have been developed to address these issues. For example, Bruna and colleagues (https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6203) introduced a smoothing method that addresses the size dependence of W by approximating it with a set of functions, each multiplied by their own scalar parameter, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc. That is, given the set of functions f1, ..., fn, \ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\ud835\udc7e\u2211\ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56. The set of functions is such that the dimensionality can be varied. However, since \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc remains scalar, the convolutions parameter space can be independent of the graph size. Other spectral convolutions worth mentioning include the Chebyshev graph convolution (https:// arxiv.org/abs/1606.09375), which can approximate the original spectral convolution at a lower time complexity and can have receptive fields with varying sizes. Kipf and Welling (https://arxiv. org/abs/1609.02907) introduce a convolution with properties similar to the Chebyshev convolutions, but with a reduced parameter burden. Implementations of both of these are available in PyTorch Geometric as torch_geometric.nn.ChebConv and torch_geometric.nn.GCNConv and are reasonable places to start if you want to play around with spectral convolutions.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 695, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

While the downsampling provided by pooling layers has been beneficial in CNN architectures, the benefit of downsampling in GNNs has not been realized as clearly. Pooling layers for image data (ab)use spatial locality, which graphs do not have. If a clustering of the nodes in a graph is provided, we can define how a graph pooling layer should pool nodes. However, it is unclear how to define optimal clustering, and different clustering approaches may be favored for different contexts. Even after clustering is determined, if nodes are downsampled, it is unclear how the remaining nodes should be connected. While these are still open research questions, we\u2019ll look at a few graph pooling layers and point out their approaches to the aforementioned issues. As with CNNs, there are mean and max pooling layers that can be applied to GNNs.

To address connectivity, the cluster is assigned the union of all edge indices in the cluster. For example, if nodes i, j, k are assigned to cluster c1, any node, or cluster containing a node, that shared an edge with i, j, or k will share an edge with c1. A more complex pooling layer, DiffPool (https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08804), tries to address both clustering and downsampling simultaneously. This layer learns a soft cluster assignment matrix \ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc7a\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b, which distributes n node embeddings into c clusters. (For a refresher on soft versus hard clustering, refer to the section Hard versus soft clustering in Chapter 10, Working with Unlabeled Data \u2013 Clustering Analysis.) With this, X is updated as X\u2032 = S TX and A as A\u2032 = S TA TS. Notably, A\u2032 no longer con- tains discrete values and can instead be viewed as a matrix of edge weightings. Over time, DiffPool converges to an almost hard clustering assignment with interpretable structure. Another pooling method, top-k pooling, drops nodes from the graph instead of aggregating them, which circumvents clustering and connectivity issues. While this seemingly comes with a loss of the information in the dropped nodes, in the context of a network, as long as a convolution occurs before pooling, the network can learn to avoid this. The dropped nodes are selected using a projection score against a learnable vector p. The actual formulation to compute (X\u2032, A\u2032), as stated in Towards Sparse Hierarchical Graph Classifiers (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01287), is: \ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \u2016\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\u2016 , \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56top-k(\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a), \ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\u2032 = (\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f\ud835\udc7f(\ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc9a))\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc68\ud835\udc68\u2032 = \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 Here, top-k selects the indexes of y, with the top k values and the index vector i being used to drop rows of X and A. Top-k pooling is implemented in PyTorch Geometric as torch_geometric.nn.TopKPooling. Additionally, max and mean pooling are implemented as torch_geometric.nn.max_pool_x and torch_ geometric.nn.avg_pool_x, respectively. Normalization Normalization techniques are utilized in many kinds of neural networks to help stabilize and/or speed up the training process. Many approaches, such as batch normalization (discussed in Chapter 17, Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data), can be readily applied in GNNs with appropriate bookkeeping. In this section, we will briefly describe some of the normalization layers that have been designed specifically for graph data. As a quick review of normalization, we mean that given a set of feature values x1, ..., xn, we update the values with \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e , where \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 is the mean and \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e the standard deviation of the set of values. Typically, most neural network normalization methods take the general form \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd, where \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe and \ud835\udefd\ud835\udefd are learnable parameters, and the difference between methods has to do with the set of features the normalization is applied over. GraphNorm: A Principled Approach to Accelerating Graph Neural Network Training by Tianle Cai and col- leagues, 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03294), showed that the mean statistic after aggregation in a graph convolution can contain meaningful information, so discarding it completely may not be desirable.

The key addition is the learnable parameter, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc, which can control how much of the mean statistic, \ud835\udf07\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57, to discard. Another graph normalization technique is MsgNorm, which was described by Guohao Li and col- leagues in the manuscript DeeperGCN: All You Need to Train Deeper GCNs in 2020 (https://arxiv.org/ abs/2006.07739). MsgNorm corresponds to the message-passing formulation of graph convolutions mentioned earlier in the chapter. Using message-passing network nomenclature (defined at the end of the subsection Implementing a basic graph convolution), after a graph convolution has summed over Mt and produced mi but before updating the nodes embedding with Ut, MsgNorm normalizes mi with the following formula: \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2032 = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2016\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u20162 \u22c5 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2016\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\u20162 Here, s is a learnable scaling factor and the intuition behind this approach is to normalize the features of the aggregated messages in a graph convolution. While there is no theory to support this normal- ization approach, it has worked well in practice. The normalization layers we\u2019ve discussed are all implemented and available via PyTorch Geomet- ric as BatchNorm, GroupNorm, and MessageNorm. For more information, please visit the PyTorch Geometric documentation at https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/ nn.html#normalization-layers. Unlike graph pooling layers, which may require an additional clustering setup, graph normalization layers can be more readily plugged into an existing GNN model. Testing a variety of normalization methods during model development and optimization is a reasonable and recommended approach. Pointers to advanced graph neural network literature The field of deep learning focused on graphs is developing rapidly, and there are many methods that we can\u2019t cover in reasonable detail in this introductory chapter. So, before we conclude this chapter, we want to provide interested readers with a selection of pointers to noteworthy literature for more in-depth studies of this topic. As you might remember from Chapter 16, Transformers \u2013 Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms, attention mechanisms can improve the capabilities of models by providing additional contexts. In this regard, a variety of attention methods for GNNs have been developed. Examples of GNNs augmented with attention include Graph Attention Networks, by Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 and colleagues, 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) and Relational Graph Attention Networks by Dan Busbridge and colleagues, 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05811).", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 698, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Next to the aforementioned graph transformers, other deep generative models have been developed specifically for graphs. There are graph variational autoencoders such as those introduced in Variation- al Graph Auto-Encoders by Kipf and Welling, 2016 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07308), Constrained Graph Variational Autoencoders for Molecule Design by Qi Liu and colleagues, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/ abs/1805.09076), and GraphVAE: Towards Generation of Small Graphs Using Variational Autoencoders by Simonovsky and Komodakis, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03480). Another notable graph variational autoencoder that has been applied to molecule generation is the Junction Tree Variational Autoencoder for Molecular Graph Generation by Wengong Jin and colleagues, 2019 (https://arxiv.org/ abs/1802.04364). Some GANs have been designed to generate graph data, though, as of this writing, the performance of GANs on graphs is much less convincing than in the image domain. Examples include GraphGAN: Graph Representation Learning with Generative Adversarial Nets by Hongwei Wang and colleagues, 2017 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08267) and MolGAN: An Implicit Generative Model for Small Molecular Graphs by Cao and Kipf, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11973). GNNs have also been incorporated into deep reinforcement learning models\u2014you will learn more about reinforcement learning in the next chapter. Examples include Graph Convolutional Policy Network for Goal-Directed Molecular Graph Generation by Jiaxuan You and colleagues, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/ abs/1806.02473) and a deep Q-network proposed in Optimization of Molecules via Deep Reinforcement Learning by Zhenpeng Zhou and colleagues, 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08678), which utilizes a GNN that was applied to molecule generation tasks. Lastly, while not technically graph data, 3D point clouds are sometimes represented as such using distance cutoffs to create edges. Applications of graph networks in this space include Point-GNN: Graph Neural Network for 3D Object Detection in a Point Cloud by Weijing Shi and colleagues, 2020 (https:// arxiv.org/abs/2003.01251), which detects 3D objects in LiDAR point clouds. In addition, GAPNet: Graph Attention based Point Neural Network for Exploiting Local Feature of Point Cloud by Can Chen and colleagues, 2019 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08705) was designed to detect local features in point cloud data, which had been challenging for other deep architectures.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 699, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

In this chapter, we explained graph neural networks from the ground up by implementing a graph convolution layer and a GNN from scratch. We saw that implementing GNNs, due to the nature of graph data, is actually quite complex. Thus, to apply GNNs to a real-world example, such as predict- ing molecular polarization, we learned how to utilize the PyTorch Geometric library, which provides implementations of many of the building blocks we need. Lastly, we went over some of the notable literature for diving into the GNN literature more deeply. Hopefully, this chapter provided an introduction to how deep learning can be leveraged to learn on graphs. Methods in this space are currently a hot area of research, and many of the ones we have mentioned were published in the last couple of years. With this text as a starting point, maybe the next advancement in the space can be made by you.

Unsupervised learning focuses on extracting patterns from data, making it useful for data compression (Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction), clustering (Chapter 10, Working with Unlabeled Data \u2013 Clustering Analysis), or approximating the training set distribution for generating new data (Chapter 17, Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data). In this chapter, we turn our attention to a separate category of machine learning, reinforcement learning (RL), which is different from the previous categories as it is focused on learning a series of actions for optimizing an overall reward\u2014for example, winning at a game of chess. In summary, this chapter will cover the following topics: \u2022 Learning the basics of RL, getting familiar with agent/environment interactions, and under- standing how the reward process works, in order to help make decisions in complex environ- ments \u2022 Introducing different categories of RL problems, model-based and model-free learning tasks, Monte Carlo, and temporal difference learning algorithms \u2022 Implementing a Q-learning algorithm in a tabular format \u2022 Understanding function approximation for solving RL problems, and combining RL with deep learning by implementing a deep Q-learning algorithm", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 702, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

As this chapter serves as an introduction, and to keep our attention on the important methods and algorithms, we will work mainly with basic examples that illustrate the main concepts. However, toward the end of this chapter, we will go over a more challenging example and utilize deep learning architectures for a particular RL approach known as deep Q-learning. Introduction \u2013 learning from experience In this section, we will first introduce the concept of RL as a branch of machine learning and see its major differences compared with other tasks of machine learning. After that, we will cover the fun- damental components of an RL system. Then, we will see the RL mathematical formulation based on the Markov decision process. Understanding reinforcement learning Until this point, this book has primarily focused on supervised and unsupervised learning. Recall that in supervised learning, we rely on labeled training examples, which are provided by a supervisor or a human expert, and the goal is to train a model that can generalize well to unseen, unlabeled test examples. This means that the supervised learning model should learn to assign the same labels or values to a given input example as the supervisor human expert. On the other hand, in unsupervised learning, the goal is to learn or capture the underlying structure of a dataset, such as in clustering and dimensionality reduction methods; or learning how to generate new, synthetic training examples with a similar underlying distribution. RL is substantially different from supervised and unsupervised learning, and so RL is often regarded as the \u201cthird category of machine learning.\u201d The key element that distinguishes RL from other subtasks of machine learning, such as supervised and unsupervised learning, is that RL is centered around the concept of learning by interaction. This means that in RL, the model learns from interactions with an environment to maximize a reward function. While maximizing a reward function is related to the concept of minimizing the loss function in su- pervised learning, the correct labels for learning a series of actions are not known or defined upfront in RL\u2014instead, they need to be learned through interactions with the environment to achieve a cer- tain desired outcome\u2014such as winning at a game. With RL, the model (also called an agent) interacts with its environment, and by doing so generates a sequence of interactions that are together called an episode. Through these interactions, the agent collects a series of rewards determined by the en- vironment. These rewards can be positive or negative, and sometimes they are not disclosed to the agent until the end of an episode. For example, imagine that we want to teach a computer to play the game of chess and win against human players. The labels (rewards) for each individual chess move made by the computer are not known until the end of the game, because during the game itself, we don\u2019t know whether a particular move will result in winning or losing that game. Only right at the end of the game is the feedback determined. That feedback would likely be a positive reward given if the computer won the game because the agent had achieved the overall desired outcome; and vice versa, a negative reward would likely be given if the computer had lost the game.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 703, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Given the large number of pos- sible inputs (the states of the system), it is impossible to label each configuration or state as positive or negative. Therefore, to define a learning process, we provide rewards (or penalties) at the end of each game, when we know whether we reached the desired outcome\u2014whether we won the game or not. This is the essence of RL. In RL, we cannot or do not teach an agent, computer, or robot how to do things; we can only specify what we want the agent to achieve. Then, based on the outcome of a par- ticular trial, we can determine rewards depending on the agent\u2019s success or failure. This makes RL very attractive for decision making in complex environments, especially when the problem-solving task requires a series of steps, which are unknown, or hard to explain, or hard to define. Besides applications in games and robotics, examples of RL can also be found in nature. For example, training a dog involves RL\u2014we hand out rewards (treats) to the dog when it performs certain desirable actions. Or consider a medical dog that is trained to warn its partner of an oncoming seizure. In this case, we do not know the exact mechanism by which the dog is able to detect an oncoming seizure, and we certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to define a series of steps to learn seizure detection, even if we had precise knowledge of this mechanism. However, we can reward the dog with a treat if it successfully detects a seizure to reinforce this behavior! While RL provides a powerful framework for learning an arbitrary series of actions to achieve a certain goal, please do keep in mind that RL is still a relatively young and active area of research with many unresolved challenges. One aspect that makes training RL models particularly challenging is that the consequent model inputs depend on actions taken previously. This can lead to all sorts of problems, and usually results in unstable learning behavior. Also, this sequence-dependence in RL creates a so- called delayed effect, which means that the action taken at a time step t may result in a future reward appearing some arbitrary number of steps later. Defining the agent-environment interface of a reinforcement learning system In all examples of RL, we can find two distinct entities: an agent and an environment. Formally, an agent is defined as an entity that learns how to make decisions and interacts with its surrounding environment by taking an action. In return, as a consequence of taking an action, the agent receives observations and a reward signal as governed by the environment. The environment is anything that falls outside the agent. The environment communicates with the agent and determines the reward signal for the agent\u2019s action as well as its observations. The reward signal is the feedback that the agent receives from interacting with the environment, which is usually provided in the form of a scalar value and can be either positive or negative. The purpose of the reward is to tell the agent how well it has performed. The frequency at which the agent receives the reward depends on the given task or problem. For example, in the game of chess, the reward would be determined after a full game based on the outcome of all the moves: a win or a loss. On the other hand, we could define a maze such that the reward is determined after each time step. In such a maze, the agent then tries to maximize its accumulated rewards over its lifetime\u2014where lifetime describes the duration of an episode.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 704, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

For example, in the case of a robot drone, these variables could include the drone\u2019s current position (longitude, latitude, and altitude), the drone\u2019s remaining battery life, the speed of each fan, and so forth. At each time step, the agent interacts with the environment through a set of available actions At (2). Based on the action taken by the agent denoted by At, while it is at state St, the agent will receive a reward signal Rt+1 (3), and its state will become St+1 (4). During the learning process, the agent must try different actions (exploration) so that it can progres- sively learn which actions to prefer and perform more often (exploitation) in order to maximize the total, cumulative reward. To understand this concept, let\u2019s consider a very simple example where a new computer science graduate with a focus on software engineering is wondering whether to start working at a company (exploitation) or to pursue a master\u2019s or Ph.D. degree to learn more about data science and machine learning (exploration). In general, exploitation will result in choosing actions with a greater short-term reward, whereas exploration can potentially result in greater total rewards in the long run. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation has been studied extensively, and yet, there is no universal answer to this decision-making dilemma. The theoretical foundations of RL Before we jump into some practical examples and start training an RL model, which we will be doing later in this chapter, let\u2019s first understand some of the theoretical foundations of RL.

The standard approach for solving MDP problems is by using dynamic programming, but RL offers some key advantages over dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is not a feasible approach, however, when the size of states (that is, the number of possible configurations) is relatively large. In such cases, RL is considered a much more efficient and practical alternative approach for solving MDPs. The mathematical formulation of Markov decision processes The types of problems that require learning an interactive and sequential decision-making process, where the decision at time step t affects the subsequent situations, are mathematically formalized as MDPs. In the case of the agent/environment interactions in RL, if we denote the agent\u2019s starting state as S0, the interactions between the agent and the environment result in a sequence as follows: {S0, A0, R1}, {S1, A1, R2}, {S2, A2, R3}, ... Note that the braces serve only as a visual aid. Here, St and At stand for the state and the action taken at time step t. Rt+1 denotes the reward received from the environment after performing action At. Note that St, Rt+1, and At are time-dependent random variables that take values from predefined finite sets denoted by \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u0302 , \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\u0302, and \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u0302 , respectively. In an MDP, these time-dependent random variables, St and Rt+1, have probability distributions that only depend on their values at the preceding time step, t \u2013 1. The probability distribution for St+1 = s\u2032 and Rt+1 = r can be written as a conditional probability over the preceding state (St) and taken action (At) as follows: \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u225d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e) Dynamic programming Dynamic programming refers to a set of computer algorithms and programming methods that was developed by Richard Bellman in the 1950s. In a sense, dynamic programming is about recursive problem solving\u2014solving relatively complicated problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. The key difference between recursion and dynamic programming is that dynamic program- ming stores the results of subproblems (usually as a dictionary or other form of lookup table) so that they can be accessed in constant time (instead of recalculating them) if they are encountered again in future. Examples of some famous problems in computer science that are solved by dynamic programming include sequence alignment and computing the shortest path from point A to point B.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 706, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Therefore, the environment dynamics are a central criterion for categorizing different RL methods. The types of RL methods that require a model of the environment or try to learn a model of the environment (that is, the environment dynamics) are called model-based methods, as opposed to model-free methods. The environment dynamics can be considered deterministic if particular actions for given states are always or never taken, that is, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u2208{0,1}.

Visualization of a Markov process A Markov process can be represented as a directed cyclic graph in which the nodes in the graph repre- sent the different states of the environment. The edges of the graph (that is, the connections between the nodes) represent the transition probabilities between the states. For example, let\u2019s consider a student deciding between three different situations: (A) studying for an exam at home, (B) playing video games at home, or (C) studying at the library. Furthermore, there is a terminal state (T) for going to sleep. The decisions are made every hour, and after making a decision, the student will remain in a chosen situation for that particular hour. Then, assume that when staying at home (state A), there is a 50 percent likelihood that the student switches the activity to playing video games. On the other hand, when the student is at state B (playing video games), there is a relatively high chance (80 percent) that the student will continue playing video games in the subsequent hours. The dynamics of the student\u2019s behavior is shown as a Markov process in Figure 19.3, which includes a cyclic graph and a transition table: Figure 19.3: The Markov process of the student The values on the edges of the graph represent the transition probabilities of the student\u2019s behavior, and their values are also shown in the table to the right. When considering the rows in the table, please note that the transition probabilities coming out of each state (node) always sum to 1. Episodic versus continuing tasks As the agent interacts with the environment, the sequence of observations or states forms a trajectory. There are two types of trajectories. If an agent\u2019s trajectory can be divided into subparts such that each starts at time t = 0 and ends in a terminal state ST (at t = T), the task is called an episodic task.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 708, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The return The so-called return at time t is the cumulated reward obtained from the entire duration of an episode. Recall that Rt+1 = r is the immediate reward obtained after performing an action, At, at time t; the sub- sequent rewards are Rt+2, Rt+3, and so forth. The return at time t can then be calculated from the immediate reward as well as the subsequent ones, as follows: \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u225d\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61+ \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61+ \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe2\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61+ \u22ef= \u2211\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 Here, \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe is the discount factor in range [0, 1]. The parameter \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe indicates how much the future rewards are \u201cworth\u201d at the current moment (time t). Note that by setting \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe , we would imply that we do not care about future rewards.

Policy A policy typically denoted by \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) is a function that determines the next action to take, which can be either deterministic or stochastic (that is, the probability for taking the next action). A stochastic policy then has a probability distribution over actions that an agent can take at a given state: \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u225d\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc43[\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60] During the learning process, the policy may change as the agent gains more experience. For example, the agent may start from a random policy, where the probability of all actions is uniform; meanwhile, the agent will hopefully learn to optimize its policy toward reaching the optimal policy. The optimal policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2217(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) is the policy that yields the highest return. Value function The value function, also referred to as the state-value function, measures the goodness of each state\u2014in other words, how good or bad it is to be in a particular state. Note that the criterion for goodness is based on the return. Now, based on the return Gt, we define the value function of state s as the expected return (the average return over all possible episodes) after following policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b : \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u225d\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b[\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61|\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60] = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b[\u2211\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61 \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 | \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60 In an actual implementation, we usually estimate the value function using lookup tables, so we do not have to recompute it multiple times. (This is the dynamic programming aspect.) For example, in practice, when we estimate the value function using such tabular methods, we store all the state values in a table denoted by V(s). In a Python implementation, this could be a list or a NumPy array whose indices refer to different states; or, it could be a Python dictionary, where the dictionary keys map the states to the respective values. Moreover, we can also define a value for each state-action pair, which is called the action-value function and is denoted by \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60).

Estimating the value function is an essential component of RL methods. We will cover different ways of calculating and estimating the state-value function and action-value function later in this chapter. Before we move directly ahead into some RL algorithms, let\u2019s briefly go over the derivation for the Bellman equation, which we can use to implement the policy evaluation. The difference between the reward, return, and value function The reward is a consequence of the agent taking an action given the current state of the environment. In other words, the reward is a signal that the agent receives when per- forming an action to transition from one state to the next. However, remember that not every action yields a positive or negative reward\u2014think back to our chess example, where a positive reward is only received upon winning the game, and the reward for all inter- mediate actions is zero. A state itself has a certain value, which we assign to it, to measure how good or bad this state is\u2014this is where the value function comes into play. Typically, the states with a \u201chigh\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d value are those states that have a high expected return and will likely yield a high reward given a particular policy. For example, let\u2019s consider a chess-playing computer once more. A positive reward may only be given at the end of the game if the computer wins the game. There is no (positive) reward if the computer loses the game. Now, imagine the computer performs a particular chess move that captures the opponent\u2019s queen without any negative consequences for the computer. Since the computer only receives a reward for winning the game, it does not get an immediate reward by making this move that captures the opponent\u2019s queen. However, the new state (the state of the board after capturing the queen) may have a high value, which may yield a reward (if the game is won afterward). Intuitively, we can say that the high value associated with capturing the opponent\u2019s queen is associated with the fact that capturing the queen often results in winning the game\u2014and thus the high expected return, or value. However, note that capturing the opponent\u2019s queen does not always lead to winning the game; hence, the agent is likely to receive a positive reward, but it is not guaranteed. In short, the return is the weighted sum of rewards for an entire episode, which would be equal to the discounted final reward in our chess example (since there is only one reward). The value function is the expectation over all possible episodes, which basically computes how \u201cvaluable\u201d it is, on average, to make a certain move.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 712, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

This greatly simplifies the computation of the value function because it eliminates the iterative loop along the time axis. Reinforcement learning algorithms In this section, we will cover a series of learning algorithms. We will start with dynamic programming, which assumes that the transition dynamics\u2014or the environment dynamics, that is, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60)\u2014are known. However, in most RL problems, this is not the case. To work around the unknown environ- ment dynamics, RL techniques were developed that learn through interacting with the environment. These techniques include Monte Carlo (MC), temporal difference (TD) learning, and the increasingly popular Q-learning and deep Q-learning approaches.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 713, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We will also move into deep Q-learning while we build some practical models. Dynamic programming In this section, we will focus on solving RL problems under the following assumptions: \u2022 We have full knowledge of the environment dynamics; that is, all transition probabilities \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60)\u2014are known. \u2022 The agent\u2019s state has the Markov property, which means that the next action and reward depend only on the current state and the choice of action we make at this moment or current time step. The mathematical formulation for RL problems using a Markov decision process (MDP) was introduced earlier in this chapter. If you need a refresher, please refer to the section entitled The mathematical for- mulation of Markov decision processes, which introduced the formal definition of the value function \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) following the policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b, and the Bellman equation, which was derived using the environment dynamics. We should emphasize that dynamic programming is not a practical approach for solving RL problems. The problem with using dynamic programming is that it assumes full knowledge of the environment dynamics, which is usually unreasonable or impractical for most real-world applications. However, from an educational standpoint, dynamic programming helps with introducing RL in a simple fashion and motivates the use of more advanced and complicated RL algorithms. There are two main objectives via the tasks described in the following subsections: 1.

For computing this value func- tion, we can adapt an iterative solution, where we start from \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\u30080\u3009(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60), which is initialized to zero values for each state.

Also, notice here that we do not need to interact with the environment. The reason for this is that we already know the environment dynamics accurately. As a result, we can leverage this information and estimate the value function easily. After computing the value function, an obvious question is how that value function can be useful for us if our policy is still a random policy. The answer is that we can actually use this computed \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) to improve our policy, as we will see next. Improving the policy using the estimated value function Now that we have computed the value function \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) by following the existing policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b , we want to use \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) and improve the existing policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b. This means that we want to find a new policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2032, that, for each state, s, following \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2032, would yield higher or at least equal value than using the current policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b . In mathematical terms, we can express this objective for the improved policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2032, as: \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2032(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u2265\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u2200\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u0302 First, recall that a policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b , determines the probability of choosing each action, a, while the agent is at state s. Now, in order to find \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2032 that always has a better or equal value for each state, we first compute the action-value function, \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60), for each state, s, and action, a, based on the computed state value using the value function \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60). We iterate through all the states, and for each state, s, we compare the value of the next state, s\u2032, that would occur if action a was selected. After we have obtained the highest state value by evaluating all state-action pairs via \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60), we can compare the corresponding action with the action selected by the current policy. If the action suggested by the current policy (that is, arg max \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) ) is different than the action suggested by the action-value function (that is, arg max \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60)), then we can update the policy by reassigning the probabilities of actions to match the action that gives the highest action value, \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60).

Reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo As we saw in the previous section, dynamic programming relies on a simplistic assumption that the environment\u2019s dynamics are fully known. Moving away from the dynamic programming approach, we now assume that we do not have any knowledge about the environment dynamics. That is, we do not know the state-transition probabilities of the environment, and instead, we want the agent to learn through interacting with the environment. Using MC methods, the learning process is based on the so-called simulated experience. Note that this technique is referred to as generalized policy iteration (GPI), which is common among many RL methods. We will use the GPI in later sections of this chapter for the MC and TD learning methods. Notation for tabular estimates of the state-value and action-value functions In most RL literature and textbooks, the lowercase \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b and \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b are used to refer to the true state-value and true action-value functions, respectively, as mathematical functions. Meanwhile, for practical implementations, these value functions are defined as lookup tables. The tabular estimates of these value functions are denoted by \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u2248\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) and \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e) \u2248\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60).

This results in a simulated episode. Earlier, we defined the state-value function, such that the value of a state indicates the expected return from that state. In dynamic programming, this computation relied on the knowledge of the environ- ment dynamics, that is, \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f|\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60). However, from now on, we will develop algorithms that do not require the environment dynamics. MC-based methods solve this problem by generating simulated episodes where an agent interacts with the environment. From these simulated episodes, we will be able to compute the average return for each state visited in that simulated episode. State-value function estimation using MC After generating a set of episodes, for each state, s, the set of episodes that all pass through state s is considered for calculating the value of state s. Let\u2019s assume that a lookup table is used for obtaining the value corresponding to the value function, \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61= \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60). MC updates for estimating the value function are based on the total return obtained in that episode starting from the first time that state s is visited. This algorithm is called first-visit Monte Carlo value prediction. Action-value function estimation using MC When the environment dynamics are known, we can easily infer the action-value function from a state-value function by looking one step ahead to find the action that gives the maximum value, as was shown in the Dynamic programming section. However, this is not feasible if the environment dynamics are unknown. To solve this issue, we can extend the algorithm for estimating the first-visit MC state-value prediction. For instance, we can compute the estimated return for each state-action pair using the action-value function. To obtain this estimated return, we consider visits to each state-action pair (s, a), which refers to visiting state s and taking action a. However, a problem arises since some actions may never be selected, resulting in insufficient explo- ration. There are a few ways to resolve this. The simplest approach is called exploratory start, which assumes that every state-action pair has a non-zero probability at the beginning of the episode. Another approach for dealing with this lack-of-exploration issue is called the \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16 -greedy policy, which will be discussed in the next section on policy improvement. Finding an optimal policy using MC control MC control refers to the optimization procedure for improving a policy. Similar to the policy iteration approach in the previous section (Dynamic programming), we can repeatedly alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement until we reach the optimal policy. So, starting from a random policy, \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b0, the process of alternating between policy evaluation and policy improvement can be illus- trated as follows: \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b0 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 \u2192 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b0 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b1 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 \u2192 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b1 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b2 \u2026 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38 \u2192 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\u2217 \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc3c \u2192 \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b\u2217", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 717, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Temporal difference learning So far, we have seen two fundamental RL techniques\u2014dynamic programming and MC-based learning. Recall that dynamic programming relies on the complete and accurate knowledge of the environment dynamics. The MC-based method, on the other hand, learns by simulated experience. In this section, we will now introduce a third RL method called TD learning, which can be considered as an improve- ment or extension of the MC-based RL approach. Similar to the MC technique, TD learning is also based on learning by experience and, therefore, does not require any knowledge of environment dynamics and transition probabilities. The main difference between the TD and MC techniques is that in MC, we have to wait until the end of the episode to be able to calculate the total return. However, in TD learning, we can leverage some of the learned properties to update the estimated values before reaching the end of the episode. This is called bootstrapping (in the context of RL, the term bootstrapping is not to be confused with the bootstrap estimates we used in Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning). Similar to the dynamic programming approach and MC-based learning, we will consider two tasks: estimating the value function (which is also called value prediction) and improving the policy (which is also called the control task). TD prediction Let\u2019s first revisit the value prediction by MC. At the end of each episode, we are able to estimate the return, Gt, for each time step t. Therefore, we can update our estimates for the visited states as follows: \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \u2190\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)) Here, Gt is used as the target return to update the estimated values, and (Gt \u2013 V(St)) is a correction term added to our current estimate of the value V(St). The value \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc is a hyperparameter denoting the learning rate, which is kept constant during learning.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 718, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

To clarify this, we can rename the actual return, Gt, to Gt:T, where the subscript t:T indicates that this is the return obtained at time step t while considering all the events that occurred from time step t until the final time step, T. In TD learning, we replace the actual return, Gt:T, with a new target return, Gt:t+1, which significantly simplifies the updates for the value function, V(St).

Notice the difference between MC and TD. In MC, Gt:T is not available until the end of the episode, so we should execute as many steps as needed to get there. On the contrary, in TD, we only need to go one step ahead to get the target return. This is also known as TD(0). Furthermore, the TD(0) algorithm can be generalized to the so-called n-step TD algorithm, which in- corporates more future steps\u2014more precisely, the weighted sum of n future steps. If we define n = 1, then the n-step TD procedure is identical to TD(0), which was described in the previous paragraph. If \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5b , however, the n-step TD algorithm will be the same as the MC algorithm.

We will cover two algorithms for TD control: an on-policy control and an off-policy control. In both cases, we use the GPI that was used in both the dynamic programming and MC algorithms. In on-policy TD control, the value function is updated based on the actions from the same policy that the agent is following; while in an off-policy algorithm, the value function is updated based on actions outside the current policy. MC versus TD: which method converges faster? While the precise answer to this question is still unknown, in practice, it is empirically shown that TD can converge faster than MC.

In this case, we will have the following: \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \u2190\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61+ \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \u2212\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)] This algorithm is often called SARSA, referring to the quintuple (St, At, Rt+1, St+1, At+1) that is used in the update formula. As we saw in the previous sections describing the dynamic programming and MC algorithms, we can use the GPI framework, and starting from the random policy, we can repeatedly estimate the action-value function for the current policy and then optimize the policy using the \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16-greedy policy based on the current action-value function. Off-policy TD control (Q-learning) We saw when using the previous on-policy TD control algorithm that how we estimate the action-value function is based on the policy that is used in the simulated episode. After updating the action-value function, a separate step for policy improvement is performed by taking the action that has the higher value. An alternative (and better) approach is to combine these two steps. In other words, imagine the agent is following policy \ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b , generating an episode with the current transition quintuple (St, At, Rt+1, St+1, At+1). Instead of updating the action-value function using the action value of At+1 that is taken by the agent, we can find the best action even if it is not actually chosen by the agent following the current policy. (That\u2019s why this is considered an off-policy algorithm.) To do this, we can modify the update rule to consider the maximum Q-value by varying different actions in the next immediate state. The modified equation for updating the Q-values is as follows: \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) \u2190\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61) + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefc[\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61+ \ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe\ud835\udefe \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e) \u2212\ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc61)] We encourage you to compare the update rule here with that of the SARSA algorithm. As you can see, we find the best action in the next state, St+1, and use that in the correction term to update our estimate of Q(St, At). To put these materials into perspective, in the next section, we will see how to implement the Q-learn- ing algorithm for solving a grid world problem. Implementing our first RL algorithm In this section, we will cover the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm to solve a grid world problem (a grid world is a two-dimensional, cell-based environment where the agent moves in four directions to collect as much reward as possible). To do this, we use the OpenAI Gym toolkit.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 720, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

OpenAI Gym comes with several predefined environments. Some basic examples are CartPole and MountainCar, where the tasks are to balance a pole and to move a car up a hill, respectively, as the names suggest. There are also many advanced robotics environments for training a robot to fetch, push, and reach for items on a bench or training a robotic hand to orient blocks, balls, or pens. Moreover, OpenAI Gym provides a convenient, unified framework for developing new environments. More information can be found on its official website: https://gym.openai.com/. To follow the OpenAI Gym code examples in the next sections, you need to install the gym library (at the time of writing, version 0.20.0 was used), which can be easily done using pip: pip install gym==0.20 If you need additional help with the installation, please refer to the official installation guide at https:// gym.openai.com/docs/#installation. Working with the existing environments in OpenAI Gym For practice with the Gym environments, let\u2019s create an environment from CartPole-v1, which already exists in OpenAI Gym. In this example environment, there is a pole attached to a cart that can move horizontally, as shown in Figure 19.6: Figure 19.6: The CartPole example in Gym The movements of the pole are governed by the laws of physics, and the goal for RL agents is to learn how to move the cart to stabilize the pole and prevent it from tipping over to either side. Now, let\u2019s look at some properties of the CartPole environment in the context of RL, such as its state (or observation) space, action space, and how to execute an action: >>> import gym >>> env = gym.make('CartPole-v1') >>> env.observation_space Box(-3.4028234663852886e+38, 3.4028234663852886e+38, (4,), float32) >>> env.action_space Discrete(2)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 721, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

The observation space for this environment is Box(4,) (with float values from -inf to inf), which represents a four-dimensional space corresponding to four real-valued numbers: the position of the cart, the cart\u2019s velocity, the angle of the pole, and the velocity of the tip of the pole. The action space is a discrete space, Discrete(2), with two choices: pushing the cart either to the left or to the right. The environment object, env, that we previously created by calling gym.make('CartPole-v1') has a reset() method that we can use to reinitialize an environment prior to each episode. Calling the reset() method will basically set the pole\u2019s starting state (S0): >>> env.reset() array([-0.03908273, -0.00837535, 0.03277162, -0.0207195 ]) The values in the array returned by the env.reset() method call mean that the initial position of the cart is \u20130.039, with a velocity \u20130.008, and the angle of the pole is 0.033 radians, while the angular velocity of its tip is \u20130.021. Upon calling the reset() method, these values are initialized with random values with uniform distribution in the range [\u20130.05, 0.05]. After resetting the environment, we can interact with the environment by choosing an action and executing it by passing the action to the step() method: >>> env.step(action=0) (array([-0.03925023, -0.20395158, 0.03235723, 0.28212046]), 1.0, False, {}) >>> env.step(action=1) (array([-0.04332927, -0.00930575, 0.03799964, -0.00018409]), 1.0, False, {}) Via the previous two commands, env.step(action=0) and env.step(action=1), we pushed the cart to the left (action=0) and then to the right (action=1), respectively. Based on the selected action, the cart and its pole can move as governed by the laws of physics. Every time we call env.step(), it returns a tuple consisting of four elements: \u2022 An array for the new state (or observations) \u2022 A reward (a scalar value of type float) \u2022 A termination flag (True or False) \u2022 A Python dictionary containing auxiliary information The env object also has a render() method, which we can execute after each step (or a series of steps) to visualize the environment and the movements of the pole and cart, through time. The episode terminates when the angle of the pole becomes larger than 12 degrees (from either side) with respect to an imaginary vertical axis, or when the position of the cart is more than 2.4 units from the center position. The reward defined in this example is to maximize the time the cart and pole are stabilized within the valid regions\u2014in other words, the total reward (that is, return) can be maximized by maximizing the length of the episode.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 722, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We will work with a grid world example, which is a simplistic environment with m rows and n columns. Considering m = 5 and n = 6, we can summarize this environment as shown in Figure 19.7: Figure 19.7: An example of a grid world environment In this environment, there are 30 different possible states. Four of these states are terminal states: a pot of gold at state 16 and three traps at states 10, 15, and 22. Landing in any of these four terminal states will end the episode, but with a difference between the gold and trap states. Landing on the gold state yields a positive reward, +1, whereas moving the agent onto one of the trap states yields a negative reward, \u20131. All other states have a reward of 0. The agent always starts from state 0. Therefore, every time we reset the environment, the agent will go back to state 0. The action space consists of four directions: move up, down, left, and right. When the agent is at the outer boundary of the grid, selecting an action that would result in leaving the grid will not change the state. Next, we will see how to implement this environment in Python using the OpenAI Gym package. Implementing the grid world environment in OpenAI Gym For experimenting with the grid world environment via OpenAI Gym, using a script editor or IDE rather than executing the code interactively is highly recommended. First, we create a new Python script named gridworld_env.py and then proceed by importing the necessary packages and two helper functions that we define for building the visualization of the environment. To render the environments for visualization purposes, the OpenAI Gym library uses the pyglet library and provides wrapper classes and functions for our convenience. We will use these wrapper classes for visualizing the grid world environment in the following code example. More details about these wrapper classes can be found at https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/58ed658d9b15fd410c50d1 fdb25a7cad9acb7fa4/gym/envs/classic_control/rendering.py.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 723, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We can then interact with it in a manner similar to that in the CartPole example. The im- plemented class, GridWorldEnv, inherits methods such as reset() for resetting the state and step() for executing an action. The details of the implementation are as follows: \u2022 We defined the four different actions using lambda functions: move_up(), move_down(), move_ left(), and move_right(). \u2022 The NumPy array isd holds the probabilities of the starting states so that a random state will be selected based on this distribution when the reset() method (from the parent class) is called. Since we always start from state 0 (the lower-left corner of the grid world), we set the probability of state 0 to 1.0 and the probabilities of all other 29 states to 0.0. \u2022 The transition probabilities, defined in the Python dictionary P determine the probabilities of moving from one state to another state when an action is selected. This allows us to have a probabilistic environment where taking an action could have different outcomes based on the stochasticity of the environment. For simplicity, we just use a single outcome, which is to change the state in the direction of the selected action. Finally, these transition probabilities will be used by the env.step() function to determine the next state. \u2022 Furthermore, the _build_display() function will set up the initial visualization of the envi- ronment, and the render() function will show the movements of the agent. Now, we can test this implementation by creating a new environment and visualizing a random epi- sode by taking random actions at each state. Include the following code at the end of the same Python script (gridworld_env.py) and then execute the script: if __name__ == '__main__': env = GridWorldEnv(5, 6) for i in range(1): s = env.reset() env.render(mode='human', done=False) while True: action = np.random.choice(env.nA) res = env.step(action) print('Action ', env.s, action, ' -> ', res) env.render(mode='human', done=res[2]) if res[2]: break env.close() Note that during the learning process, we do not know about the transition probabilities, and the goal is to learn by interacting with the environment.

Initially, we start with a high value of \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16 , but the _adjust_epsilon() method reduces it until it reaches the minimum value, \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16min. The choose_action() method chooses an action based on the \ud835\udf16\ud835\udf16-greedy policy as follows. A random uniform number is selected to determine whether the action should be selected randomly or otherwise, based on the action-value function. The _learn() method implements the update rule for the Q-learning algo- rithm. It receives a tuple for each transition, which consists of the current state (s), selected action (a), observed reward (r), next state (s\u2032), as well as a flag to determine whether the end of the episode has been reached. The target value is equal to the observed reward (r) if this is flagged as end-of-episode; otherwise, the target is \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc44\ud835\udc44(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e). Finally, for our next step, we create a new script, qlearning.py, to put everything together and train the agent using the Q-learning algorithm. In the following code, we define a function, run_qlearning(), that implements the Q-learning algo- rithm, simulating an episode by calling the _choose_action() method of the agent and executing the environment. Then, the transition tuple is passed to the _learn() method of the agent to update the action-value function. In addition, for monitoring the learning process, we also store the final reward of each episode (which could be \u20131 or +1), as well as the length of episodes (the number of moves taken by the agent from the start of the episode until the end). The list of rewards and the number of moves is then plotted using the plot_learning_history() function: ## Script: qlearning.py from gridworld_env import GridWorldEnv from agent import Agent from collections import namedtuple import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np np.random.seed(1)", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 732, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

A glance at deep Q-learning In the previous code, we saw an implementation of the popular Q-learning algorithm for the grid world example. This example consisted of a discrete state space of size 30, where it was sufficient to store the Q-values in a Python dictionary. However, we should note that sometimes the number of states can get very large, possibly almost in- finitely large. Also, we may be dealing with a continuous state space instead of working with discrete states. Moreover, some states may not be visited at all during training, which can be problematic when generalizing the agent to deal with such unseen states later. To address these problems, instead of representing the value function in a tabular format like V(St), or Q(St, At), for the action-value function, we use a function approximation approach. Here, we define a parametric function, vw(xs), that can learn to approximate the true value function, that is, \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60) \u2248\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0b(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60), where xs is a set of input features (or \u201cfeaturized\u201d states). When the approximator function, qw(xs, a), is a deep neural network (DNN), the resulting model is called a deep Q-network (DQN). For training a DQN model, the weights are updated according to the Q-learning algorithm. An example of a DQN model is shown in Figure 19.10, where the states are represented as features passed to the first layer: Figure 19.10: An example of a DQN Now, let\u2019s see how we can train a DQN using the deep Q-learning algorithm. Overall, the main approach is very similar to the tabular Q-learning method. The main difference is that we now have a multilayer NN that computes the action values. Training a DQN model according to the Q-learning algorithm In this section, we describe the procedure for training a DQN model using the Q-learning algorithm.

Now, this func- tion should be changed to perform a forward pass of the NN model for computing the action values. The other modifications needed for the deep Q-learning algorithm are described in the following two subsections. Replay memory Using the previous tabular method for Q-learning, we could update the values for specific state-action pairs without affecting the values of others. However, now that we approximate q(s, a) with an NN model, updating the weights for a state-action pair will likely affect the output of other states as well. When training NNs using stochastic gradient descent for a supervised task (for example, a classification task), we use multiple epochs to iterate through the training data multiple times until it converges. This is not feasible in Q-learning, since the episodes will change during the training and, as a result, some states that were visited in the early stages of training will become less likely to be visited later. Furthermore, another problem is that when we train an NN, we assume that the training examples are IID (independent and identically distributed). However, the samples taken from an episode of the agent are not IID, as they form a sequence of transitions. To solve these issues, as the agent interacts with the environment and generates a transition quintu- ple qw(xs, a), we store a large (but finite) number of such transitions in a memory buffer, often called replay memory. After each new interaction (that is, the agent selects an action and executes it in the environment), the resulting new transition quintuple is appended to the memory. To keep the size of the memory bounded, the oldest transition will be removed from the memory (for example, if it is a Python list, we can use the pop(0) method to remove the first element of the list). Then, a mini-batch of examples is randomly selected from the memory buffer, which will be used for computing the loss and updating the network parameters.

As shown in Figure 19.12, we perform two forward passes of the DQN model. The first forward pass uses the features of the current state (xs). Then, the second forward pass uses the features of the next state (\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032).

From the transition quintuple, we know that action a is selected by the agent. Therefore, according to the Q-learning algorithm, we need to update the action value corresponding to the state-action pair (xs, a) with the scalar target value \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5f \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u2032\u2208\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc34\u0302 \ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc60\u2032, \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4e\u2032).

Alternatively, we can use the deque data structure from the Python collections library, which allows us to specify an optional argument, max_len. By specifying the max_len argument, we will have a bounded deque. Therefore, when the object is full, appending a new element results in automatically removing an element from it. Note that this is more efficient than using a Python list, since removing the first ele- ment of a list using pop(0) has O(n) complexity, while the deque\u2019s runtime complexi- ty is O(1).

Chapter and book summary In this chapter, we covered the essential concepts in RL, starting from the very foundations, and how RL can support decision making in complex environments. We learned about agent-environment interactions and Markov decision processes (MDPs), and we considered three main approaches for solving RL problems: dynamic programming, MC learning, and TD learning. We discussed the fact that the dynamic programming algorithm assumes that the full knowledge of environment dynamics is available, an assumption that is not typically true for most real-world problems. Then, we saw how the MC- and TD-based algorithms learn by allowing an agent to interact with the environment and generate a simulated experience. After discussing the underlying theory, we im- plemented the Q-learning algorithm as an off-policy subcategory of the TD algorithm for solving the grid world example. Finally, we covered the concept of function approximation and deep Q-learning in particular, which can be used for problems with large or continuous state spaces. We hope you enjoyed this last chapter of Python Machine Learning and our exciting tour of machine learning and deep learning. Throughout the journey of this book, we\u2019ve covered the essential topics that this field has to offer, and you should now be well equipped to put those techniques into action to solve real-world problems. We started our journey in Chapter 1, Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data, with a brief overview of the different types of learning tasks: supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and unsupervised learning.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 743, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

We continued to discuss advanced classification algorithms in Chapter 3, A Tour of Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-Learn, and we learned about the most important aspects of a machine learning pipeline in Chapter 4, Building Good Training Datasets \u2013 Data Preprocessing, and Chapter 5, Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction. Remember that even the most advanced algorithm is limited by the information in the training data that it gets to learn from. So, in Chapter 6, Learning Best Practices for Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning, we learned about the best practices to build and evaluate predictive models, which is another important aspect in machine learning applications. If one single learning algorithm does not achieve the performance we desire, it can sometimes be helpful to create an ensemble of experts to make a prediction. We explored this in Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning. Then, in Chapter 8, Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis, we applied machine learning to analyze one of the most popular and interesting forms of data in the modern age, which is dominated by social media platforms on the internet\u2014text documents. For the most part, our focus was on algorithms for classification, which is probably the most popular application of machine learning. However, this is not where our journey ended! In Chapter 9, Predict- ing Continuous Target Variables with Regression Analysis, we explored several algorithms for regression analysis to predict continuous target variables. Another exciting subfield of machine learning is clustering analysis, which can help us find hidden structures in the data, even if our training data does not come with the right answers to learn from. We worked with this in Chapter 10, Working with Unlabeled Data \u2013 Clustering Analysis. We then shifted our attention to one of the most exciting algorithms in the whole machine learning field\u2014artificial neural networks. We started by implementing a multilayer perceptron from scratch with NumPy in Chapter 11, Implementing a Multilayer Artificial Neural Network from Scratch. The benefits of PyTorch for deep learning became obvious in Chapter 12, Parallelizing Neural Network Training with PyTorch, where we used PyTorch to facilitate the process of building NN models, worked with PyTorch Dataset objects, and learned how to apply preprocessing steps to a dataset. We delved deeper into the mechanics of PyTorch in Chapter 13, Going Deeper \u2013 The Mechanics of PyTorch, and discussed the different aspects and mechanics of PyTorch, including tensor objects, computing gradients of a computation, as well as the neural network module, torch.nn. In Chapter 14, Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, we dived into convolutional neural networks, which are widely used in computer vision at the moment, due to their great perfor- mance in image classification tasks. In Chapter 15, Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks, we learned about sequence modeling using RNNs. In Chapter 16, Transformers \u2013 Improving Natural Language Processing with Attention Mechanisms, we introduced the attention mechanism to address one of the weaknesses of RNNs, that is, remembering previous input elements when dealing with long sequences. We then explored various kinds of trans- former architectures, which are deep learning architectures that are centered around the self-attention mechanism and constitute the state of the art for creating large-scale language models.", "type": "text"}, "metadata": {"page": 744, "content_type": "text", "section_path": [], "source_stage": "pdf_text"}}

Previous chapters were centered around tabular datasets as well as text and image data. In Chapter 18, Graph Neural Networks for Capturing Dependencies in Graph Structured Data, we focused on deep learning for graph-structured data, which is commonly used data representation for social networks and molecules (chemical compounds). Moreover, we learned about so-called graph neural networks, which are deep neural networks that are compatible with such data. Finally, in this chapter, we covered a separate category of machine learning tasks and saw how to develop algorithms that learn by interacting with their environment through a reward process. While a comprehensive study of deep learning is well beyond the scope of this book, we hope that we\u2019ve kindled your interest enough to follow the most recent advancements in this field of deep learning.
